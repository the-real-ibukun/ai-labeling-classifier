emmcd19,"I've literally seen a doctor break down and cry in surgery and I would trust her with my own animal in a heartbeat because she shows the same compassion, thoroughness, and thoughtfulness that you show just in the way you have written this post. It sounds like the culture at the hospital you're working at is toxic and gross. If you think you should quit, you already have your answer. I worked in environments like that as a new CVT hoping things would work out and it never did. As a new vet the world is ur oyster. Go out there and find the right team for you.|Oh you're the kind of doctor I get along with, OP. they're the kind of techs I hate to work with.

mirmarti437,I think in our field you really do have to fight for your salary. It sucks that we as support staff get paid so little but if you are at a decent company you can fight for raises. I’ve been an assistant for 3 years and have had to challenge every raise I’ve gotten and have always gotten more. Take advantage of the shortage right now and know how much you’re worth as an experienced assistant! ❤️ if they don’t offer you a raise it may be worth looking elsewhere.,Other,i think field really fight salary it sucks support staff get paid little decent company fight raises i assistant years challenge every raise i gotten always gotten take advantage shortage right know much worth experienced assistant offer raise may worth looking elsewhere,Veterinarian
Wild_Sea9484,"I'm sorry but calling the ER is a courtesy not a right. And if you're gonna keep me on hold for more than 15 minutes you're loosing the courtesy. 


Additionally, has anyone seen the ER care decrease tremendously in the last years? Just transfered a case to Blue Pearl for a clear obstruction that I did not have time to cut myself, xrays and all. And they send it home with Cerenia. Came back couple of days later to resect some bowel. |No we're not intimidated, but it's the hold times that kill us. It takes less than 5 minutes to to refer a case, you just have to come to the phone.


We can do what you do, we just don't have the equipment or the staff and we're on a schedule. I can't deal with a DKA in a 30 minute slot and I don't have regular insulin or overnight care. 


What really grinds my gears is when ER vets talk down to me as if we're ignorant and don't understand appropriate medicine. |I'm with you. That was my thought at first too. Then I saw the discharge report on their portal.


Not the first time. My colleague saw an old dog with an untreated umbilical hernia that recently got bigger and seemed to have intestines in; confirmed on AUS, dog was painful, etc.  We again sent it for sx and it got kicked back. 


O was very motivated and understood the outrageous cost that they're charging now. I mean 7k for a hernia repair and if hospitalization is needed 3k more? Come on. 


Might just be my own local Blue Pearl. When I was in school the ERs arround there were excellent. |I'm with you on that, if you can stabilize you should. |You win some you lose some. Keep it up. You're doing great. Don't let a bad comment define you. |WELL....depends how well you're doing. If you feel very confident in your spays, then don't come in. If you don't....then yeah. You should come in. Mentorship is a two way street. He doesn't make production in your cases so why would he go out of his way to teach you? This isn't school anymore. You need to have mentorship as part of your compensation package, ideally written out in contract, if you want to have a dedicated day where a more experienced vet will teach you. That way HE is also compensated for his time. 

&#x200B;

That being said. Don't worry too much. Few people stay at their first job.|Yeah this seems like a hospital issue. Also ""ovarian remnants""? Really? I think your college should take some serious CE. Lyme I could understand, but how do you miss IMHA? 


With so many jobs available just go find one that values you. Very few people stay at their first job. |I'm sorry but calling the ER is a courtesy not a right. And if you're gonna keep me on hold for more than 15 minutes you're loosing the courtesy.

You're doing great. Don't let a bad comment define you. |Jesus that's low. In a busy practice? That's less than working at petco or shotvet. Are you the owner or have a stake in the company?|I agree with you. I'm a vet. Base is 150k with bonuses I make around 200k. Cost of living in my area is lower. I'm not a specialist, in fact I graduated about 3 years ago. I work 38 to 40 hours a week (including 1 hour lunch breaks) and I usually leave on the dot or rarely 30 minutes after closing (for notes). It's a pretty good gig. Also at least right now there is tremendous job security. I have 20 offers in my inbox of places that would love to take me. I have an awesome mentor and I actually work corporate. I don't understand why people complaint. There is NO shortage of jobs. If you don't like your situation just advocate for yourself or switch jobs.|DId you specialize? otherwise I see no reason why you would do 2 internships let alone one. Also your loans are SUPER high. Average is 250k for 4 years NOW.|I agree with you. I don't know what we're complaining about. This is like the golden age of veterinary medicine. Salaries have never been as good as they are now.|Haha I'm sorry. and this makes more sense. Surgery is tough, you must not like sleep or any semblance of a normal life. I almost went IMED but decided against is for QOL. I'm hoping you make 1/2 mill starting out so it balances.

murkyscientist4,"So many people are going to tell you not to bc of the difficulty or the money or whatever their opinion is. If it feels right for you, go for it! Step into the fear, the unknown! What is the worst that happens? You go back into your old career or find something else if you hate it? At least you won’t have the regret of never knowing. And I’m sure you’ll learn a ton about yourself along the way! Plus, time just keeps going so why not apply yourself to something that you think will be more fulfilling? All we have is time really. I get bored so continually doing something new is my jam. 

Anyways, I say this, because you are me. I started vet school at 31 and will graduate this year at 35. I’m going into an internship after graduation and hopefully onto residency after that! Absolutely meant to be and so glad I jumped off the cliff and went for it.

You won’t need to complete another undergraduate degree but certain pre-requisites to apply. Go here: https://www.aavmc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/VMCAS_2025_ApplicantGuide.pdf

VMCAS is where you apply and all the information should be in there that you need. You should be able to make a login and browse things through there or just go to the general website. You could also look up specific school requirements online or meet with an advisor at a local college or your previous Alma mater and get some advice on where to start. You’ll need things like chem 1 and 2, orgo, calculus, so I’m sure you’ll have some done already.  While you are working on pre-requisites try to get some experience such as vet assistant work somewhere. You’ll definitely need some experience in order to get in but this being a second career you also have other life and leadership experience that other applicants don’t have. You can also apply to an island school which are probably a little bit easier to get in. More cost, but absolutely amazing experience overall. Absolutely loved living in the Caribbean! I’m the adventurous type though. Best of luck to you! How exciting! You got this 👊🏼|Following! I have also applied to match and am wondering similar things. To add to your list: Michigan, Penn, Wisconsin, Texas, Florida and Virginia-Maryland.|So many people are going to tell you not to bc of the difficulty or the money or whatever their opinion is.

Zebrasoma,"IMO having worked for a GP who did a lot for the community like that you are unfortunately inviting a lot of problems when you offer credit arrangements and cheap to free vaccine clinics. It devalues the rest of your services and invites a certain type of client. Why would someone pay full price for a vaccine if they can wait till the free clinic? Why would someone pay their bill if they know a credit program exist? When we raised prices to just cover the cost of the supplies people lost their minds. It’s just a harsh reality of the field, people suck and will take advantage of a good thing. That’s why these models of petco vet clinic things work. There are certainly the subset of people who could pay if they would but it’s not the majority. 

I don’t think it’s bad, but even though I want to do good in the world I would have no interest in a job like that because I’ve seen the reality. It would have to be very well run to avoid the pitfalls of barely staying above water and so perhaps it’s worth highlighting that in the job description somehow. Just highlighting all the fluffy things you do may strike concern.   

And as an aside there is a subset of vets (I am one of them) who are not supportive of TNR. We even went over it in school as a debate topic because it’s controversial. There is minimal evidence it’s a good long term control method and it leads to worse outcomes for wildlife and for cats. I would not want to fight that battle with an owner and perhaps new grads feel the same.|You’re not wrong but…I feel like in the non profit world there is so much wrong with the vet situation.

MooCowMoooo,"Have you considered in-home euthanasia? People who work for Lap of Love always seem very happy and fulfilled.

If you asked me in my first 5 years if it was worth it, I would have said absolutely not. Relief work allows you freedom to avoid the many clinics that will work you to death. It pays well, you don’t have to deal with the usual clinic drama, and people are grateful that you are there helping.

Unfortunately, you probably need to do some regular GP for a couple of years before you do relief, to get experience and feel comfortable as a solo practitioner.|Have you considered in-home euthanasia? People who work for Lap of Love always seem very happy and fulfilled. I looked into it once and always have it in the back of my mind to do if I burn out again.|I have heard polarizing opinions.

On one hand, people say they love it. They get paid very well. The fact that clients see everything seems to be a benefit as they can see pets being triaged and better understand why they have to wait.

On the other hand, I’ve heard that the culture is ridiculous and the vet is expected to take every phone call because clients are told they can always reach a doctor. Even if that means taking a phone call to talk about flea control while scrubbed into surgery. 

I’m intrigued by them, but I don’t think I could do my job with clients watching my every move. And I get a lot of cult vibes from them. The people who love it seem so devoted and seem to have nothing bad to say. And the matching t shirts at the conferences. If a documentary came out in 10 years about it being a cult, I wouldn’t be shocked 😂|Do you feel you have enough experience to work alone? If so, I recommend trying relief work for a while.

It’s good money, keeps things fresh and interesting, everyone is appreciative of you, and the daily staff drama doesn’t grind you down.

I have a friend who does relief through VetIQ which seems like a good option if you need benefits.

I think having a good mentor early on in career is the best thing for a new grad.

FrostyMeowmeow,"I had a similar feeling when I first started working as a veterinary assistant in 2015 after I graduated college, and it took a year of ""soul searching"" to figure out what I wanted to do with my career, as my degree was in general biology with a pre-med track. I decided medical school wasn't my calling and enjoyed the concept of medicine, but also the concept of zoology.


I shadowed for a few weeks with a general practitioner before applying for several clinics. I finally got a job, and the whiplash alongside the learning curve was highly discouraging. I vividly remember thinking at the end of my second week, ""What the hell did I get myself into?""


The learning curve is STEEP, but you'll learn to celebrate small victories. It's okay to feel as if your client interactions don't go smoothly or if you could've done something better handling an animal or assisting with a procedure.

My first goal in veterinary school was to obtain enough information to be a small animal general practitioner. During my last year of clinics, I realized the world of medicine is MUCH MUCH MUCH more profound than it appears. I'm finishing my last year of specialty training (almost four years post-doc). The further you get along in your training, the more science you incorporate into clinical practice.

I decided to do a small animal internal medicine residency because it's not GP. GP practitioners have demanding jobs in that they see high volume, are expected to be jacks of all trades, and must be highly pragmatic in diagnostic choices as frontline doctors. 

I'm fortunate to pick up where they left off after several weeks to months of diagnostics and management strategies. They do the filtering to recommend motivated owners to see a specialist. Internal medicine is still very client-heavy interaction. However, remember that other specialties do not necessarily require front-facing interactions with the public; you are still expected to have communication skills to interact with your colleagues and paraprofessional team, and depending on where you do your training -- students. Specialty is dependent on your interactions in the clinic with specialists in your area of interest, but also part of the pre-clinical curriculum with activities and clubs that serve as networking opportunities. These aren't things to worry about just yet -- you'll have plenty of time to investigate should you continue schooling.

Take it one day at a time. It will be hard, but there will also be great days along the road that make you look back with a big smile on your face, knowing that you've made a difference in somebody and their best friends' lives.",Veterinarian,i similar feeling i first started working veterinary assistant i graduated college took year soul searching figure i wanted career degree general biology track i decided medical school calling enjoyed concept medicine also concept zoology i shadowed weeks general practitioner applying several clinics i finally got job whiplash alongside learning curve highly discouraging i vividly remember thinking end second week what hell i get the learning curve steep learn celebrate small victories it okay feel client interactions go smoothly could done something better handling animal assisting procedure my first goal veterinary school obtain enough information small animal general practitioner during last year clinics i realized world medicine much much much profound appears i finishing last year specialty training almost four years the get along training science incorporate clinical practice i decided small animal internal medicine residency gp gp practitioners demanding jobs see high volume expected jacks trades must highly pragmatic diagnostic choices frontline doctors i fortunate pick left several weeks months diagnostics management strategies they filtering recommend motivated owners see specialist internal medicine still interaction however remember specialties necessarily require interactions public still expected communication skills interact colleagues paraprofessional team depending training students specialty dependent interactions clinic specialists area interest also part curriculum activities clubs serve networking opportunities these things worry yet plenty time investigate continue schooling take one day time it hard also great days along road make look back big smile face knowing made difference somebody best friends lives,Veterinarian

TH3R3V3R3ND,"Here’s my 2 cents: way too many people view VetPrep as like a completion competition and it becomes mindless question regurg (not vomiting those two are different 😝) instead of any real learning. I passed only having completed ~40% of VetPrep because I didn’t do any of the timed exams and focused all my attention on the regular questions where I made a google doc and typed out a sentence or two reinforcing the key concept of each one as I answered it, right or wrong. As you do this you strengthen recall from the multimodal approach of typing and thinking, plus you end up with a giant reference you can control F for quick recall and making connections to new material as you encounter it. For example if I was on pig diarrhea or something I’d control F salmonella to see if I had a reference to it in chickens, and if not incorporate that at the time.

SprinkleOfWisdom,"Sure you can. I’ve worked with a small animal vet who then worked at the zoo a certain day of the week. So, you could work as an exotics vet and work with a certain zoo. Not all zoos can afford to have a full time vet. Also a lot of specialists might get called in to help at the zoo. Zoo vets are often huge generalists, so they often might phone in for advice from specialists - even human MD specialists. I saw that especially with primates. Possibilities are there, it just may limit some of your location options. The most important thing is to know there are options and focus on vet school, building good relationships, and trying different experiences in vet med. You may evolve your interests too which is great.|I'm a veterinarian in the US, so while I don't know the details of veterinary school systems internationally, I can say with confidence, that I would recommend shadowing several different types of veterinarians as well as the other roles inside of the veterinary practice including on the business side such as the practice manager. Observe what they do. Ask them what they like and dislike about their job. What would they like for their career path? Ask what they wish they knew or had done when they were your age. Never put all your opinions into one person. Take what they say and apply it to what you seem to enjoy and your values. Have fun and stay curious about possibilities. :)",Veterinarian,sure i worked small animal vet worked zoo certain day week so could work exotics vet work certain zoo not zoos afford full time vet also lot specialists might get called help zoo zoo vets often huge generalists often might phone advice specialists even human md specialists i saw especially primates possibilities may limit location options the important thing know options focus vet school building good relationships trying different experiences vet med you may evolve interests veterinarian us i know details veterinary school systems internationally i say confidence i would recommend shadowing several different types veterinarians well roles inside veterinary practice including business side practice manager observe ask like dislike job what would like career path ask wish knew done age never put opinions one person take say apply seem enjoy values have fun stay curious possibilities,Veterinarian

Unless you are in an extremely rural area, there is generally no good reason to stop and the best thing you can do is call for emergency services and give any information you can (ie: there's an accident involving 2 vehicles in the first lane, located on I-80 E about 0.5mi before exit XYZ). We covered good Samaritan laws pretty extensively, generally they are in place to protect people with no medical training and unfortunately we live in a litigious society.

You can upload your Identity to Metamask using .json file via upload feature, but it won't list you any MYST tokens because it's restricted by the smart contract. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/105oxhq/how_do_i_import_my_wallet_from_android_for_use_as/j3gjcb1/ | https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015489331-How-to-import-an-account ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/105oxhq/how_do_i_import_my_wallet_from_android_for_use_as/j3h578q/ | Currently, it's not technically possible to run a Mysterium node on Flux. The good thing it's in our roadmap as we are planning to support it. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/1059oa0/mysterium_on_flux/j3gfoiz/ | I am following up on this one.

As mentioned in my previous post, there might be several reasons for such outcome. It might be MTU misconfiguration on server itself, certain issues with firewall on host machine and other.

While trying to test connect to your failing node, I got the error "" `(Client.Timeout while waiting for response header)`"" meaning that connection to location oracle was established, but response wasn't returned. Sometimes TCP connections hang like this when there is ICMP blackhole with misconfiguration in MTU.

Can you please list interfaces on virtual machines with `ip l` command?What is MTU values for the external network interfaces? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/1035ypu/connection_failed/j36hrdl/ | Well, I'm trying to connect to your node in consumer mode. That basically it.

What about ip l command? Can you please provide us with the output of failing nodes? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/1035ypu/connection_failed/j38v9ho/ | It looks like it's not a MTU issue. Can you please check one more detail:

1. If location oracle is available: `curl '`[`https://location.mysterium.network/api/v1/location/`](https://location.mysterium.network/api/v1/location/)`'`
2. What is PMTU value for path to location oracle: `tracepath location.mysterium.network`. We need all output, while the most important are the last lines of output, like `\`Resume: pmtu 1500 hops 14 back 13\``. On debian-like systems this utility is available in package`iputils-tracepath\`.

Thank you! ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/1035ypu/connection_failed/j3kynvy/ | Hey there,

The anesthesiologist will approve drug protocols, assist techs if there’s an issue during a procedure, and also consult with other departments if they need help with premed/sedation protocols. Some also do phone consults with other practices that don’t have an anesthesiologist.

There is free in person tutoring the whole first year and lots of club events with free food. It also seems like clinical year is not as brutal here from what I’ve heard about other schools. 
If you’re into outdoorsy things it’s a great location. There’s a mountain range, reservoir, lots of hiking/camping nearby and something like 300 days of sun a year. It’s very bikeable but outside of campus it takes awhile to walk anywhere substantial. 
It’s a smaller city which could be a pro or a con depending on what you like but there’s a cute little downtown area with lots of shops and restaurants.

Veterinarians and other vet staff can work in research/academia, clinical private practice, and industry jobs like in government agencies or pharmaceutical companies.|Spay/neuter clinics and animal shelters usually always need volunteers. You could also see if there are any farm/horse sanctuaries or wildlife rehabs near you that need help to get experience that isn’t just small animal.|I would highly recommend working as an assistant before applying to vet school so you really know what the field is like. If you’re set on being a veterinarian I don’t think it’s worth spending the time/money on getting a tech license first.

For most US schools, If you want to apply as an early admissions you would need to apply during this cycle in order to go to vet school in fall 2025. You will need to have it planned so your prereqs will be done by then. Not every school allows early entry and it varies how many out standing prereqs you can have at the time of application so you need to look into each school on their admissions websites. You can apply again as a traditional student in 2025 to be admitted fall 2026.|You’ll apply to go to vet school after your undergrad (there are specific classes and experiences required to get in), and then after vet school most people do an ER mentorship program or rotating internship to get experience before working completely on their own.

Highly_Sugared,"Veterinary practice: How do I go about it?

Hi, my name is Leonardo, and my absolute dream job is to be a DVM. I've been doing a lot of research but I thought I'd ask first hand for some of my questions as it's a little difficult to find in things like articles. I am currently a freshman in highschool and have started animal science as my CTE. I assumed this would be the right path to go since it's focused mainly around veterinary practice. I live on a ranch with my family, which is mainly what aspired me to want to go into the veterinary feild; that and my compassion for animals in general.

1. My main struggle is college as I can't find any clear answers on how that works. It seems that it's all variables which I'm having a hard time comprehending. If someone could clearly explain that in a more step-by-step format it would probably help as most of the articals I read are very long-winded and hard to understand.

2. Anytime I try reading about the process of entering the veterinary feild it's almost discouraging as everything ends with 'It's not worth it'. All I hear about it how terrible the student loan debt is and that most vets live miserably. Is it not worth it to enter the veterinary feild?

3. Just how rough are the student loans and is there any way to dampen them even just a bit? I have a job working at one of my local restaurants that pays well enough for a minimum wage job and I plan on saving as much of that as I can for college. 

4. Is there a specific course you have to take for large animal veterinary medicine (cows, goats, horses, etc.) or is it also taught alongside small animal veterinary medicine? This one also confuses me because it seems there not exactly a clear answer here either.

Thanks in advance everyone !!!",Veterinarian,veterinary practice how i go hi name leonardo absolute dream job dvm i lot research i thought i ask first hand questions little difficult find things like articles i currently freshman highschool started animal science cte i assumed would right path go since focused mainly around veterinary practice i live ranch family mainly aspired want go veterinary feild compassion animals general my main struggle college i ca find clear answers works it seems variables i hard time comprehending if someone could clearly explain format would probably help articals i read hard understand anytime i try reading process entering veterinary feild almost discouraging everything ends worth all i hear terrible student loan debt vets live miserably is worth enter veterinary feild just rough student loans way dampen even bit i job working one local restaurants pays well enough minimum wage job i plan saving much i college is specific course take large animal veterinary medicine cows goats horses etc also taught alongside small animal veterinary medicine this one also confuses seems exactly clear answer either thanks advance everyone,Veterinarian

Pancakesmith,"I’m still pre-med so I’m barely racking up animal experience but from this side, I love having even a small part in making animals happier. A large part of my rolls have included cleaning up animal poop but I’ve never been happier cleaning up poop simply because I got to hang out all day with animals and know that I made their lives brighter ❤️☺️|Thank you for the reminder☺️❤️ that is a great point. Thanks 😊|I’m so sorry you had to experience this. Please remember you did the very best that you all could given the timing and situation. My mom who also works to save lives tells me to remember that in order to push through these tragedies we have to remember that our job is to do our very best since we can’t win every time.
I feel like that’s the only advice I have to not absolutely break down during things like this. I clutch on to it. I know it doesn’t make everything better but it’s like a reminder. 
But I understand the pain. I’ve been on the side of the pet parent who lost two young dogs traumatically due to sudden internal bleeding due to cancer and one day if I’m ever privileged enough to be on the vet side I hope I can still remember this advice from my mom. 

I just graduated undergrad and am prepping for vet school. This is all stuff I think about a lot but I just wanted to give you a verbal hug and remind you that you’re giving the gift of helping as much as you can which is so much better than leaving an animal entirely without an effort. 😔 

I think we always have to cope with not being able to save everyone and I also don’t know how other than to try to think of what my mama said. 
She works with children as a respiratory therapist and sees very tragic things too. 

*my spirit sends yours a hug as well as to everyone else who has to deal with this*|This is great advice. Thank you.|Yes, I relate to the asking. I think that’s so natural for all humans to do when faced with tragedy. 
The pup’s humans took the decision in their hands when they decided that. Perhaps they knew ribs could break during that and didn’t want that for their already suffering dog, or who knows why, but they decided and even if you do not know, they for whatever reason felt that would be least stressful for them and perhaps even the animal. 

I know we are going to be around a lot of hard things and I encourage you to see if you are able to speak with a professional therapist every now and then too since depression in our field is so high. It might help. Ik it’s helped me in the past with maintaining a positive mindset. 

For anyone reading there’s also an organization called Not One More Vet which works to transform the mental health of veterinarians ❤️|That seems better. What school?|Nice, congrats ❤️|Thank you for replying ❤️ Do they sell tempeh? :)

I wish these experiences were more well known to the general public and pet owners. I’m stumbled across this after seeing some strange dynamics at my dog’s last visit at one of the Mars owned chains and I wanted to research a bit. 

I was interested in finding a new veterinary practice that’s kind to their staff because (selfishly) that staff is who is taking care of my baby. And after reading through this, as a consumer I have a responsibility to spend money responsibly and avoid companies with unhealthy labor practices.

KittyKatOnRoof,"Yeah, my biggest critique of a lot of these hospitals is a lack of teaching hospitals. My school has interns, residents, 4th years, 3rd years, and students from the Caribbean schools without a teaching hospital. We barely have the case load and staff to adequately teach these students. Adding more students in classes does nothing to remedy the need for more places to practice and hone clinical skills such as S/N, diagnosis, client communication, etc, etc, etc. Many of these schools have no plans to build a clinical hospital alongside. So their students will be sent in to hospitals that may not be able to adequately teach them. |I would go for cheapest. I went to a tiny state school for undergraduate, was one of the top picks for my first choice school and my friend got into Cornell. You can save money, and use your time wisely to get involved in extracurriculars, research, and veterinary experience that will help you stand out a lot more than a prestigious school. |Leptospirosis (urine) and rabies (saliva) are the big ones. Bites can cause bacterial infections. |I mean, if you have a passion for shelters, there is a ton of work you can do to take the management, advocacy, and organization off the vets to make a big impact. Oftentimes, it's not just lack of vets or techs willing to do this work, it's lack of supplies, money, and organization power. I've worked with vets who can spay a dog every ten minutes. If they had access to an environment to help them, they could make a huge impact. But they're hindered by the legalities of operating, using controlled drugs, etc. |Yes! I loved sending new owners home with a magnet of our local ER. My parents still have one, and it was very useful when my dog's eye started bleeding and they panicked. |If you've finished the prerequisite classes, yes.

I was made to see a therapist for ""my problem"".  (So they have been doing that for a while). I admit there was a shit rolls downhill attitude,  and it took a while for me to learn to help with students who were afraid of me as well. I am sorry for anyone that I made feel less, but the pressure to not screw up was phenomenal.  Cut to the ""me too"" and ""black lives matter"" movements- I contacted your  department of diversity.  Just to see if that sort of crap was still happening.  I hoped it was better. Also to see if I could finally get my intern certificate( I still havent gotten it, even though it was promised 3 or 4 years ago)  The part that really infuriates me, is that a I found out a  surgeon there was really against my doing a surgical residency- even though I had been told multiple times I was very talented, and did a lot of solo surgery there- and that he had done the same thing to other african american candidates.

student_of_theGame,"No, you can fire a client and it’s usually best if you have documented evidence of instances that are of high severity or high frequency. Typically, you’d send a letter to the client along with copies of the pets medical record. So that they have no reason to return. 

If your hospital has access to a lawyer or lawyer services, they’d be able to draft up a client fire letter which would state specific instances as to the reason and would provide the client with the location of another hospital that they can visit. 

Hope this helps!|Another feature that most veterinary PMS completely ignore is controlled drug logging. It can definitely be part of the PMS and there are a few companies out there that focus on digital record keeping. 

Another pain point for vets is in states with a prescription monitoring program (PMP) employees have to submit controlled drug dispensation information manually. Controlled drugs that are dispensed from the hospital must be reported to the state. Human systems have a built in feature that allows the data to be sent to the state automatically(via a txt file organized in ASAP format). I believe only one veterinary PMS has that functionality. What we’re left with is techs or managers entering drug dispensation data into a portal to send to the state. This is super time consuming and a solution would save tons of time.",Veterinarian,no fire client usually best documented evidence instances high severity high frequency typically send letter client along copies pets medical record so reason return if hospital access lawyer lawyer services able draft client fire letter would state specific instances reason would provide client location another hospital visit hope helps feature veterinary pms completely ignore controlled drug logging it definitely part pms companies focus digital record keeping another pain point vets states prescription monitoring program pmp employees submit controlled drug dispensation information manually controlled drugs dispensed hospital must reported state human systems built feature allows data sent state automatically via txt file organized asap format i believe one veterinary pms functionality what left techs managers entering drug dispensation data portal send state this super time consuming solution would save tons time,Veterinarian

Visible_Damage851,"Hey all! New to reddit, but stumbled upon this forum while doing veterinary school research so I thought it was worth a shot. I'm a junior biology student who is looking to apply for a PPVM program this Fall. I interned at a clinic my senior year of high school and have been working seasonally since then to complete around 1,275 paid hours as a VA. I'm pretty involved on campus and have numerous leadership positions within important organizations. I'm holding a 3.94 after the hardest semester of my college experience and I'm picking up two large animal shadowing opportunities this semester. With my program not having an entry exam or even an interview process, I'm feeling extremely nervous about how competitive it's going to be. At this stage, I'm looking to build a spotless and diverse resume for my application. Are there any opportunities I should be seeking out? Are there any changes I should make?|Thanks for your response :) Research is something I considered a little too late. It's something I may do my senior year in the Spring after my application, but right now I'm hoping to find shadowing opportunities outside of the standard small animal clinical setting. Hoping to work again later this semester, but school is going to come first, especially to hold my GPA. Worst case scenario, I'll be working this summer and likely most of the next semester.

(And Guelph was one of my top 3 schools, but I think they required one pre-req class I didn't take in undergrad.) Do you mean transferring into a DVM/MPH program??|I am not exactly sure why he said to go get an MPH, because I don't know what I would do with one either! I didn't bring up the idea. I would just go back to my pre-vet school R&D lab job. 

I thought about lab animal med! I'm personally not super comfortable working with lab animals though, even though I worked with them before vet school and even work with them now part-time. It would depend a lot on the study and I don't think you're allowed to be *that* picky? My irrational ex-vegan guilt catches up with me sometimes.|Thank you for the support. The residents here are awesome! They just don't seem very happy? The two I work with are both in the old combined PhD residency and our school recently switched to a combined Master's instead. One of them mentioned the other day that they would have definitely preferred the shorter route. Can you provide any insight into that decision in your experience? Aside from not feeling like I belong here, I am also worried about committing another 6 years to schooling when I'm already 31.|Thank you! May I ask what you ended up doing with your degrees? And how you found mentors?|The biggest upside would be not taking up another 2 years of debt. If I left at this point, I could eventually pay it off with my back-up career. 😅|Thank you so much for sharing!! It feels better to know I'm not actually alone in the vet med world, and that someone has already made it out the other end. I am having a difficult time finding mentors (and externships that are not specifically for third/fourth year students) and would appreciate any insight? I applied to a couple externships for the summer but haven't heard back yet. I do work at the wildlife lab (research and necropsies!) - I love the work, I love my coworkers, and I am so in awe of my boss and her career but she is retiring and working remotely at this point. The wildlife pathologist who led me to vet school is having some health troubles and understandably doesn't have the time or energy for me. I feel like a lot of my anxieties are due to bad luck or bad timing.|Thank you for your insight! I love the pathologists at my school! I did apply for a diagnostic pathology fellowship for this summer but haven't heard back yet. I had some discouraging words from one of the pathologists the other day though, that I should have been showing that I was more interested in pathology somehow, or should already have a pathology case study published, should be visiting path programs at other schools, should have been working as a timeslip at the diagnostic lab, etc. It made me feel like I was already behind and it would be a very steep uphill climb to get into a residency at this point.|Thank you for sharing! You should know there are surprisingly a lot of equine students in my class! But it definitely helps me feel better to know it's not just me. 🙂|Tufts was one of my dream schools! I applied to their DVM/MPH program, but didn't get in. I will reach out to them for sure! Thank you.|I worked at an exotics-only vet for a couple years before vet school, and I work in the wildlife research lab now. I definitely want more experience with wildlife, but I think clinical exotics would be too much for me. I am not sure I'd like to be dealing with exotics clients every day for the rest of my life. 😅|Thank you. I did apply for some dual programs but wasn't accepted. I paraphrased the criticism (but those exact words were used). But I think his biggest points were that I don't have an exact plan of where I see myself in 10 years, I'm not searching out enough opportunities (""why don't you have a fellowship with the CDC already?""), and that I will hate vet med because I don't want to be a SA clinician (that was my bad for mentioning I would consider doing SA GP/ER/relief work for a couple years to pay off my loans).|Thank you! Yes, his point was that I don't have any clear goals with a 10-year plan. I have been having a difficult time finding mentors because of my interests, though I think it's mostly bad luck.

JonLivingston2020,"I'm a Ph.D. neuroscientist with a serious interest in medical matters and comfortable with terminology.   I research my pets' conditions carefully and observe their behavior closely.  I don't tell a doc or vet about my education or what I have done for a living.   That said, both docs & vets pretty much pick up on it the moment I start speaking.  I can tell by their demeanor.  Maybe once or twice I've had someone talk to me in a way that felt patronizing, but most speak to me as an equal and I appreciate that.|That's a toxic and disrespectful environment if you ask me.   Having the rudeness to actually say such things to your face?  Even if they were true, and they obviously are not. 

You either need to quit or to come up with some snappy come backs that will put them in their place.   Maybe it's a weird initiation rite of some kind.

At least, where I live.|It may have nothing to do with it.   Your supposition appears to be that I'm claiming the abusers are female.   IMO it could go either way, but if significant numbers are, then it would argue against the claim made for years, that if women were in charge of the world everything would be sunshine & bunny rabbits.

It comes with the territory, when a person has high standards.   Just breathe & take it one day at a time.|Yes|Yes that is terrible.  In my area where cost of living is high, tech positions are being advertised at $19-$30 per hour.   I paid a software programming intern $30/hour back in 2006.    And techs are so important to the whole client experience (moreso these days when most vets do the entire workup behind closed doors and only speak to the client for 10 minutes at the end).|Still, it's unfair.   Software programmers with undergrad degrees start at $130k in high tech.   Less education and far less importance in my view.   Vets should get more, but the problem is the business model.  Human medicine is underwritten by a vast insurance network & massive government subsidies.   High tech is flying high on sales.  Both have $$$ to burn.  Vets depend alnost 100% on a client paying their bill.  I'm sorry that's the case.  Pet insurance is not underwritten by employers and far too expensive for most people.|Well I hope you get it and I hope you receive the appreciation you deserve as well.  :)|Your answer makes no sense.

step1step2profit,"For cardio, the best path is probably to do an academic internship at a place with a well known rotating internship and cardiology program. I haven't been in the match for awhile, but it seems like interns from CSU, Tufts, Ohio, TAMU, NC State, and some others were the most likely to match their general rotating interns to a residency. So I can't answer your question about externship vs research program directly; go for whichever one is most likely to get you in a top academic internship.

That being said, while it's great to know that you want to do cardiology so early in your career, make sure to have an open mind going into the rotating internship. Your impression of a specialty will likely change once you step into your role as a clinician. It's also important to first be a good clinician in all aspects, not just cardiology. The specialty world is small and it is not uncommon for residency committees to reach out to friends in non-cardiology specialists to ask about candidates (unofficially).",Medical Doctor,for cardio best path probably academic internship place well known rotating internship cardiology program i match awhile seems like interns csu tufts ohio tamu nc state others likely match general rotating interns residency so i ca answer question externship vs research program directly go whichever one likely get top academic internship that said great know want cardiology early career make sure open mind going rotating internship your impression specialty likely change step role clinician it also important first good clinician aspects cardiology the specialty world small uncommon residency committees reach friends specialists ask candidates unofficially,Veterinarian

BatInternational1548,"I am a certified hospice and palliative care veterinarian and it is a wonderful field where we can do so much good for pets and their families.

Hospice care just means your treatment goals change from pursuing a cure to pursuing comfort and quality of life - whatever that means for the specific pet and the family (usually aggressive symptom management but also home modifications and other things).

I also have a Synology NAS that I am going to move some of these containers over to (especially the ones that don't have native Apple silicon support).

It wasn't Filecoin, that looks much more polished than whatever I was running. It gelt like it was still very early on as a product. Again, the fact that I cannot find anything about it, remember it's name, hell...I don't even know what wallet it was going to, that has me thinking it died off.

But speaking of Filecoin. When I google around that seems to be the first thing that comes up, and the most popular. Curious why you didn't include it in your list? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/11zmvfy/what_other_similarfun_projects_do_you_run/jdk3t8x/ | So, I finally remembered what it was. scPrime was what I was running around 1-2 years back. Apparently it is still around, but wasn't showing up in any of my google searches for distributed cloud storage. I might give that a try as well, and let you know.

Regarding Filecoin, I did see that their requirements are much higher, and the setup process is more involved, so I stopped looking into.

g0thfrvit,"It was definitely the worst financial decision I’ve ever made. I wouldn’t choose it again, based on the debt to income ratio alone. It’s just a fact.|It’s the feeling of being quizzed or scrutinized, and also feeling as though they’re judging what I’m using or the protocol I have chosen, and I resent it when it feels like it’s being done by someone who doesn’t really have a place to do that.|Agreed. When I get the question it never sounds like it’s just “out of curiosity”. It’s people asking questions that they don’t even know what to do with the information when they get it that puzzles me and makes me wonder why they’re asking or why they want to know.

It’s also in like the last 5 of the vet school standings| Some places give estimates, some don’t. It’s not that weird. The places that don’t, do so bc they’ve been burned by clients receiving an estimate over the phone in the past. We give a range of cost and say they need to come in for the exam to determine better. The only thing I don’t agree with is the final cost being 3x the estimate. Estimates are such for a reason, but our estimates give a high end and a low end, so owners know what it could *potentially* end up being. But when you’re getting into hundreds of dollars past what someone is expecting, that’s a problem with communication and the person making the estimate.|I have mine as Firstname Lastname, DVM|I don’t really encounter that issue bc I introduce myself as Dr. Lastname.|I’m not saying I’ve never been addressed as my first name, but it’s really rare.|Except I hate my first name so I will not be happy to be called Dr. Firstname lol|It was definitely the worst financial decision I’ve ever made.

You can get forgiveness once you’ve made 120 monthly payments while working at least 30 hours/week at a non-profit/gov/eligible employer. But if you wanted to take a break from non-profit, and work ER for a year, you can do it! It delays forgiveness, but at least you aren’t tied down. Which to me, is a little less scary. You can also do for profit relief at the same time, though this extra income will affect your IBR payments.

Don't be scared to start something new and don't regret starting late. You learned a lot about life during a period when other people were learning mostly school stuff. This means you have gained some practical skills that you wouldn't have any other way - that time was not in vain at all!

wondalfy,"I'm loving UC-Davis. I think the workload, at least so far (as a first-year), is very manageable. I've actually done a lot more stuff with friends than I did in undergrad! Often times, we even get dedicated study times blocked off (with nothing scheduled) before exams. Many days we get done at 3, have breaks in between, or get off even earlier. Sometimes ofc we do have a full 9-5, but it's not very common. I also really like how the curriculum is set up in blocks! I like the integration of material into one system.

Many will disagree with me, but I think there is so much to do nearby too. I think many students are already from large cities in California, so it (understandably) seems like a downgrade. I am not from California - in fact I'm from a very rural state - so there's a lottttt more than I'm used to. It's very easy to go visit San Francisco or Tahoe (skiing!) for a day.

It’s only a weekend only, small clinic, so I’m not just going to be shadowing, and the only experienced employee is the vet.

galactose,"Shit happens and things die even when you do everything right. 

When I was in my first year of vet school, one of my professors said “things will die, no matter what you do. And things will also survive no matter what you do. Try not to take yourself so seriously “, and that statement has helped me a lot.

Being responsible for the death of a pet isn’t a matter of “if”, it’s a matter of “when”. You just need to take comfort in knowing that you did your best, and that you will help more animals than you hurt in the long run. I lost a pet under anesthetic a few weeks ago, and it was completely unexpected. I felt really sad afterwards, but then I moved on so that I could be in a good place to help other pets. You can’t carry that shit around with you or it will literally kill you. It wasn’t the first time and it won’t be the last, unfortunately.

croissantsplease,"👏👏👏|Ultimately, don’t let anyone tell you how to feel, but…. It *feels* to me like you have a passion for advocacy and rescue, but that is so different from the actual medical side of things. To give you some perspective, I’m applying to vet school this year, I’m in my 30s and came from the humanities/education/research. It’s taken 2 years to get the experience and prereqs needed for veterinary school, it is quite the process! BUT, I came in because I LOVE medicine, and slowly found my way to this over time. I find working in a clinic very rewarding, but damn, there are also days that tear your heart out. You can’t save them all in vet med, and it just sucks- the worst are the terrible clients who can pay but let their animals suffer because they don’t care. And there’s really not much we can do about that. I say all this not to say you shouldn’t do it, but I think your passion may be in a different aspect of veterinary/shelter medicine that is SO NEEDED. For example, in many states , low cost spay/neuter funding goes underutilized because the process it apply for grants is so top-heavy that vets (at least the ones I know have said this) give up out of frustration. There is real, valuable skills you could bring with your current passions- if they involve school, great! But they don’t HAVE to. Best of luck, definitely try to do some shadowing in a clinic to get a feel before taking the plunge.|I am applying to veterinary school this year and some family members look at me oddly when I say that I feel really passionate about a couple things, including oncology and end-of-life care.

Affectionate_Net_213,"I work in clinics with computers in exam room, I talk while I examine and pause to enter important details.  

If it’s a second opinion or complex case, I get the info first. Or if the pet looks stressed and needs a few minutes to relax in the exam room.

It is super important to be concise, and efficient.|When I was an ECC intern at a private practice where my longest shift was 28 hours…. Physical exercise helped tremendously.  There was a 24h gym nearby and I would go when my shift ended (2-3am) and exercise, then go home and sleep.  Definitely helps your body reset, but yeah….

As a veterinarian, it naturally takes time to be able to trust someone else to prevent everyone from getting hurt.  I’ve worked with some amazing restrainers, but until I see them in action and feel comfortable, I won’t ask them to restrain a fractious animal.  

I would give it some time, keep offering. Sometimes just jumping in to be a “butt holder” shows initiative and understanding.|Everything they offer should be written into the contract, if it’s not, there’s no recourse if they decide to no longer offer it.

There are employment lawyers in every major city, just ask around for recommendations (if you have a local Facebook group it’s a great place to gather recommendations).  Generally a consult (they review the contract and advise) will be $250-500, it will be money well spent.

You should absolutely have an employment lawyer review every single contract before signing.|It’s generally much better to get your own policy and have your employer reimburse you.  That way you know that the premium is covered (ie what happens if they lapse a payment and you are uninsured and happen to be sued?).  This way you also get to know exactly what your coverage is, as there is always a risk that a lawsuit could name the clinic and you personally.

The university interns had it pretty good compared to the essentially free labour we offered private practice (I often worked 20 hours per day).  Learned a lot though.|Stay away from UPEI, their case load is very low and you will not get as many opportunities for networking and case management.|Be mindful that you don’t overstep your role, it’s likely that many of the questions the client asked should have resulted in an appointment being made with the veterinarian.

Answering questions about drugs not prescribed, especially around doses (since many people have Valium/diazepam at home) definitely borders on practicing without a license, which you need to be extremely mindful of.  As an assistant/receptionist/vet tech you cannot discuss medications not prescribed, and many times if drugs are prescribed you should be checking your answers with the DVM first. 

If the hospital DVM is not available, again, it’s a very short call.  You can offer to take a message and pass it to the DVM and direct them to emergency services.|Don’t call.

When a patient is in hypovolemic shock and they aren’t able to oxygenate their tissues properly (and oxygen is used in the cells during cellular respiration to make ATP which powers the cells), the cell metabolism has to switch to anaerobic which produces lactate, that leads to metabolic acidosis… all of this changes how we treat the patients!|I work in clinics with computers in exam room, I talk while I examine and pause to enter important details.

moo_moo_motherfuckR,"Day = made|In my experience--and I'm generalizing, here, so take it with a grain of salt--I've found that human nurses tend to be some of the the most disrespectful clients in vet med.

Once, my supervisor took a phone call with a client who was requesting to be prescribed (prescription-only) flea meds for her dog. My supervisor explained that we need to have seen her dog in the last year for an exam before we can get those scripted out, and she was overdue for one. The lady protests, and my supervisor explains that it's literally the law. We HAVE to see the pet. Client goes: ""Look, I'm a nurse. I understand that's the law. But trust me, my dog is healthy. Just prescribe the meds.""

My supervisor says no.

Client demands to speak to a doctor, like a doctor is going to tell her any different.

My supervisor hangs up. It was quite literally the only time I've ever seen her do that.

In Mexico (where I'm from), there is an oversaturation of small animal clinics and hospitals in the cities, but most of them offer poor benefits and salaries, and starting your own clinic is not that easy.

I'm in the same situation. I don't have too many references with small clinics, but I've read that Banfield is offering around $100k/year plus production and a signing bonus for new grads (I'm not sure, but I think it's around $35-50k). I'm not sure if that's the average situation, but small clinics are offering a signing bonus of maybe $5k to help cover NAVLE, visa, and relocation expenses.|I appreciate your comment.|I appreciate your comment.

I had some schoolmates from the US and other countries, and I believe the tuition per year for foreigners is around US$1k, with living costs ranging from US$350+ per month, depending on your personal needs. They also mentioned that it was quicker since we can start right after high school without needing to go to college first. It's a 5-year program plus 6 months for social service, and the time it takes to complete your project degree (around 6-6.5 years in total).

I would like to hear about your personal experiences with the requirements and the cost of university. It would be very interesting considering that these are very different situations, especially for Mexicans who study at UNAM, where tuition fees are very low due to being subsidized by taxes (which is why the acceptance rate to this university is extremely low and it has around 250k students in different majors and campuses). It's crazy that with 1 US dollar, we could cover the tuition fees for the 5 years of veterinary school for 243 students (25 peso cents per year per student).

I'm planning to take the NAVLE next year.|Do you already pass the NAVLE?
I know some companies working with Mexico to bring vets to the states; maybe you can find something similar for the UK.

I know you have to say everything that needs to be said, but I think you know you have to try other clinics before you give up.

Don't project clinic based issues onto the career as a whole. You will become unfairly disenfranchised.|Consider North America as well, if you want to earn a lot more money and get some savings behind you.

I'm from Aus as well, the NAVLE wasn't hard.|No I never ended up going. I have 2 friends who did and they loved it. Both went to Canada and then 1 of them moved to the US for a bit. 

The money is WAY higher than in Australia. You could easily pay off your HECS and save up for a little travel. 

The downside is that the work-life balance in the US is pretty bad. At least that seems to be the typical story. Canada will pay a bit less than the US but work life balance seems better. 

Both of my mates came back eventually to be closer to home. They both came back with much more money saved than I had managed to save, helped them get a house and pay off HECS. 

They got to snowboard in Canada, see the national parks, camp in the wilderness and meet new friends. 

The cold was a big issue for them. They missed our summers.|Yea I love it. Lots of people will be pessimistic in conversation about the veterinary industry. Honestly though, I love it and our income/life balance/career opportunities are growing so nicely. Best time to be a vet in history. 

Enjoy the journey|Very true, the nurses need more pay for sure, abysmal really. 

There needs to be a bunch of social shifts and economical revamps to the industry to see a change. 

Support staff in the US aren't exactly earning much in a relative sense, the ratios of vet:vet tech or vet:RVN are the same between nations. (Think approx $180k-200k:70k USD and 140-150k:60k AUD). The main difference is that you can survive better on 70k USD on average. However the radio demonstrates that Aus doesn't support their non vet staff any more or less than the US, the industry as a whole is just less profitable because an RVN is less qualified than a tech.

If they don't pay vets more they will continue to leave overseas. Improved veterinary standards were always going to come before the support staff. It's unfortunately how the economics work. 

The shift is now towards vets doing less consulting and more prescribing/surgery, that and insurance mentality will drive change in the overall pay (but ratios will remain the same).

Its such an odd industry as a whole. That being said, we are all better off than 10 years ago. Support staff and vets.|Yea it's definitely a rose tinted view.

Parody101,"I'm so sorry hun. Definitely get out when you can. The job market still seems great for vets. Get out and find somewhere better for you. I was stuck in a crappy loop with my first/old clinic and leaving was the best thing I ever did. I thought I was burning out of veterinary medicine/wanting to be a vet. Turns out I was just done being there. Every clinic has challenges, no where is perfect...but still.|“It’s better than nothing” in the face of the same sort of studies is definitely the same sort of thing. The irony is lost on them sadly. 

The first clinic I worked at prescribed Metro frequently so it became ingrained to me. Had an internal medicine doctor prescribe it as a component to IBD treatment for one of my patients that really seemed to help her. Nowadays I’m definitely more focused on probiotics and diet changes/fiber if the fecal float is negative, but I still do occasionally prescribe if all else fails. It is tough to overcome for sure. 

Just keep the studies in mind the best you can and focus on your own medicine, that’s all you can do.|So while I would say that a work-life balance is improving for most vets, there are still many that can't achieve it currently. Unfortunately even before that, vet school itself is rigorous.

SupaGinga8,"Depending on where you are, the amount of “hands on” tech work you’re allowed to do can vary. If you’re in a state with title protection, then you’ll either have to start as an assistant or consider going to tech school. If there isn’t title protection in your state, then I say find a place that’s willing to train you on the job as a tech. People get really uptight about title protection and uncertified techs performing that role. While I agree that you shouldn’t be doing things you’re not trained in or are uncomfortable performing, I do think that with the right training and environment you can get your feet wet and see what the field is like. Free continuing education is your friend! Find an area that interests you and seek out lectures, conferences, journals, even textbooks in that subject. I went close to 6 years as a vet assistant before moving to a state that allowed for licensure through my accrued hours of work and just recently got my RVT license. 

As far as the field in general, there will be long days. There will be emotionally charged situations with clients. Statistically, every single one of your patients will die before you do (assuming you don’t work with some crazy long lifespan species). But there is so much to learn and immerse yourself in and so much good to be done. Consider the R.O.A.D. to happiness in vet med as one of my mentors put it: Radiology, Ophthalmology, Anesthesiology, and Dermatology. Plenty of medicine without a lot of the stress and grueling work of things like emergency care, critical care, urgent care, etc (those vets/techs are the real MVPs, don’t get me wrong. I’m grateful for every one of them and admire their work ethic and dedication wholeheartedly).|I had several classmates over 50 in my vet school class.|Whatever you do, do not under any circumstance take out private loans.

HumanProject7893,"Hey! I did a graduate programme with V4P and I have to say the training is very good, definitely worth it. However, the downside of this programme (and most of new grad programmes I know from corporates) is that the actual CPDs/training are quite scarce in the sense that you'll do one every couple of months (roughly). The training has a good quality but they give it to you in small sporadic doses so that you have to stick with them during those 2 years, not that it takes 2 years to do that training at all lol. You'd be able to do it in 1-2 months if anything.

So it was overall a good quality programme and a nice extra if you're just planning to do GP for a while with no rush, but if you were thinking of maybe doing a certificate or an internship (these programmes are NOT an internship) etc I'd tell you to do the certificate at the same time with the new grad programme (totally doable time-wise) or do an internship directly.

Edit: with scarce I mean that I wish they were done more often, not that the content is not enough.

It’s far better to make these mistakes in a supervised situation where you have a safety net and other professionals that will catch them (before they can seriously impact a patient’s health) 
I taught in a vet tech program for many years. And when we’re in lab situations with live animals, I would tell them, “This is your safe space to make mistakes. Make these rookie mistakes here while you’re supervised, so you don’t make them in the real world”

laserxop,"Speaking from a government vet perspective. 

Not only did I go through a similar thing (not feeling like I was cut out to do clinical work), I actually had a greater interest in Veterinary public health and pathology. You said it's mostly an ""office job"". Federal? State? Or are you outside the US? 
I, myself, took the official veterinarian route. 
I actually started off working for the government of NZ where not only did I carry out verification of sanitary procedures, was also in charge of handling animal welfare issues and conducted compliance visits at a number of farms. 
The work life balance was pretty sweet indeed. 
I did end up moving ""into an office"" eventually where I was dealing with animal imports and animal import products. It was mostly policy but, again, offered further work life balance. 

Fast forward to 2022 and I am State side working for the USDA as a Public Health Veterinarian. If this is the govt job you are talking about, it is certainly not an office job... haha. I guess it does depend on the location but I would say it does put your knowledge to test. Particularly pathology. 
I'm no longer in that role and, yeah, now I'm in a role that's a bit more removed from Veterinary medicine. One that still involves a lot of technical skills and whole lot of soft skills. Still, I view my current role as a stepping stone. There are definitely roles that do require clinical knowledge through APHIS as well. 

Not sure if you were one of those that dreamed of working in a veterinary clinic. That wasn't quite me. So I at least wanted to share some perspective on the government vet role. It may not be your thing, but there are definitely a lot of opportunities through government vet roles. 

Goodluck with whatever you decide! :)",Veterinarian,speaking government vet perspective not i go similar thing feeling like i cut clinical work i actually greater interest veterinary public health pathology you said mostly office job federal state or outside us i took official veterinarian route i actually started working government nz i carry verification sanitary procedures also charge handling animal welfare issues conducted compliance visits number farms the work life balance pretty sweet indeed i end moving office eventually i dealing animal imports animal import products it mostly policy offered work life balance fast forward i state side working usda public health veterinarian if govt job talking certainly office job haha i guess depend location i would say put knowledge test particularly pathology i longer role yeah i role bit removed veterinary medicine one still involves lot technical skills whole lot soft skills still i view current role stepping stone there definitely roles require clinical knowledge aphis well not sure one dreamed working veterinary clinic that quite so i least wanted share perspective government vet role it may thing definitely lot opportunities government vet roles goodluck whatever decide,Veterinarian

CatPolitics101,"I would look into the animal shelter where you currently work for any job openings as a vet assistant. Your biggest strength will be your ability to handle/restrain animals, so focus on that. There is no shame in using muzzles until you are 100% comfortable. 

After you get some experience, then look into jobs at a GP. Working in GP will allow you to broaden your experience further with more complex surgeries and routine vet care. Working in GP will also allow you more time to go back to school if you decide to do so. 

Now, if you're anything like me, you'll want to go into emergency medicine. I switched from GP to ER 2 years ago and I'll never go back. I'm not licensed (yet), but I still get to do most hands on things, except for what only a licensed tech can do. I focus primarily on inpatient care, so I perform venipuncture, administer medications and treatments, monitor anesthesia, scrub in for surgery, take radiographs, you name it. I make $25 an hour currently and am on track to make $27 by the end of next year. I only make this amount because I work in ER, GP usually pays less. 

I also made the change from corporate America 4 years ago, and I've never looked back. There is a hell of a learning curve, and often pushback depending on your clinic, but it has been so rewarding. Just be patient with yourself because there is a lot to learn, but it will come with time.|It's definitely a thing. It's less common in smaller GPs, but happens alot in ER and specialty.",Veterinarian,i would look animal shelter currently work job openings vet assistant your biggest strength ability animals focus there shame using muzzles comfortable after get experience look jobs gp working gp allow broaden experience complex surgeries routine vet care working gp also allow time go back school decide now anything like want go emergency medicine i switched gp er years ago i never go back i licensed yet i still get hands things except licensed tech i focus primarily inpatient care i perform venipuncture administer medications treatments monitor anesthesia scrub surgery take radiographs name i make hour currently track make end next year i make amount i work er gp usually pays less i also made change corporate america years ago i never looked back there hell learning curve often pushback depending clinic rewarding just patient lot learn come definitely thing it less common smaller gps happens alot er specialty,Veterinarian

srosem343,"for anyone that did not pass, you will still be a wonderful doctor. Take a break from this emotional week, and start fresh next week. I know many great vets who are so intelligent and kind -- and they failed once or twice. It does not mean shit, and you CAN do it again. Everyone is rooting for it!! Friendly reminder to be kind to everyone this next week, I imagine it would feel pretty crummy to watch everyone celebrate, but don't let it break you. It will be okay!! No one can be YOU, and thats why we need you in the profession. Give yourself some grace, no one here is a failure <3|It’s funny because I know that I would never judge anyone for failing— this test is absolutely not indicative of your abilities and intelligence as a doctor— yet I know that I will feel shame and disappointment, and I’m dreading the part when people ask if I passed. I can’t fake it. But the test was long. I felt ready as ever walking in, and was so numb when I walked out. Took me like a full week to process it and then I went, “oh my GOD I think I failed!”

I’m crossing my fingers and toes for everyone this week. We can do this! And we can do it again if we must 🤍|Nothin like a little extra stress from the ICVA faking us out on a super fun day (I have stress colitis)|Me too I was in rounds on my clinical rotation and was waiting for it to be over— went to check and I get the no documents available message! I should’ve just been a big girl and clicked the pdf when i had the chance. This is torture!! 😭|some of my class can see theirs, but i can't see mine and neither can a few others. I'm not sure if its related to whether the result is pass or fail....hope not|Just got mine too|imo that would be cruel and unusual punishment|i think they can still see it|no idea, they haven't said|where? i dont see it|I’m also waiting 😫 some days i feel like “I kicked ass I DESERVE to pass” and then other days I’m like “you left seven questions open on section two bc you didn’t time manage so that’s probably the 7 questions you needed to pass”. It’s so hard. Plus it’s clinical year now and the minute we get that email everyone will be talking about it… I’m not sure my poker face is too good. Screw the shame and guilt. Who CARES if you fail, we will get up and do it again and we will learn something that may save a life one day. Happens for a reason. But it in no way reflects how amazing we’ve all done to have gotten this far, and (I have to remind myself too) a fail does NOT mean you will be any less worthy to work with animals and love what you do. 

Soooo long story short I’m panicking and feeling nauseous with all of you every time my email gives me a notification!

My lessons:
- alcohol. Not recommended 
- overeating. Not ideal but it could be worse. 
- shopping. Eventually you’ll be able afford this I hope
- inappropriate outbursts. Sometimes helpful but not consistently 
- kicking inanimate objects. Very helpful, be sure not to hurt yourself 
- walking the dogs, rolling around with dogs, kissing dogs. Very helpful 
- feeding the hospitalized patients. Literally my favorite activity ever. 
- realizing that 1/3 patients will get better no matter what you do. 1/3 patients you can help. 1/3 patients will not improve no matter what you do. So focus on that 1/3 and reducing suffering in those we can’t help much.

Especially solo owners who don’t want to sell to corporate are highly motivated and may sell for property value alone.

50 weeks a year = $500,000.

If I were you I try to would politely, but firmly, let them know that those aren’t acceptable comments to make. It’s more than them not trusting you— they actively don’t respect you, and they need to if you’re going to have a good working relationship. Don’t just go to your boss (though definitely also do that so they know what’s going on), but you need to take them aside and tell them directly, without making it about your feelings.

Most diagnostic centers have placed a hold on hiring and industry has definitely slowed down. Also, pharma almost always requires a concurrent PhD.|Some of these comments are absolutely insane and just speak to how toxic the culture is in vet med. For most of you, stop cherry picking what OP said in the post. If the technician is calling the other doctors by their last name/title and refusing to call OP by it then it’s not a lack of respect, it is active disrespect. As a technician, I would never have disrespected a doctor like that. As a doctor now, I would expect the same respect as my other colleagues. I go by my first name because that’s how I like it, but as someone who was once a technician, the appropriate thing to do is to call them by their last name/title at first and feel it out or simply ask the what they prefer. 

For those of you saying that respect is earned, OP earned that shit by completing 8+ years of schooling to get their degree (13+ for some of us). Did they know everything coming out? No. None of us do. Most of us understand that and are welcome to constructive advice (which I think it’s clear that OP is). What should not be acceptable is the nitpicking and hazing that is often given to new grads. There is a way to respectfully give advice. If you are a technician OR a doctor, this is a useful skill to learn. Technicians know things doctors don’t know and doctors don’t know things technicians know. Instead of belittling each other, they should create an environment where people are open to ask questions and share advice.|I think a lot of other people made some good points so I’m not going to repeat a lot of it.

Zora74,"A nice fruit basket would be lovely and very appreciated, and generally it can be eaten by everyone even if someone on staff is diabetic or has a chocolate allergy. 

You Could also ask if your hospital has a rescue fund for people who can’t afford treatment and make a donation to that, or donate to a local rescue they work with in your kitty’s name.|BluePearl has the EmERge program that, as far as I know, doesn’t have a set start date. However, from what I’ve seen working in a BP in the NYC market, they don’t provide the mentorship they promise. If you do that route, I would ask to speak to people who’ve done the entire program at the hospital you are thinking of enrolling.

Sorry, I just looked into it, and they have a July/January start time as well, with the first four weeks having to be done in Tampa|Turn off the iso and the oxygen for flipping otherwise you’re just blowing the iso in the tubes into the room and when your patient is hooked back up they have a lower concentration of iso in the breathing system.|I don’t think any practice would make an estimate for a sick animal that they haven’t seen, because they can’t know what, exactly, is going on or if the treatment plan your vet proposed is the one they would follow. They also would t know what diagnostics have already been run, and diagnostics are a huge portion of any sick pet invoice. 

Giving a ballpark for a routine spay/neuter isn’t that uncommon because those are typically healthy pets and very straightforward procedures.|It isn’t uncommon for practices to not want to give out ballpark figures for their procedures, but I feel like that is changing with time. Many will have a list of typical spay/neuter prices at reception so the receptionists don’t even have to ask anyone. 

I don’t see why invoices should be consistently over estimates by such a large margin in a GP practice. The only thing I can think of where invoices could run high with some regularity would be dental procedures, but even those should have a wide range on the estimate because we know that we don’t have a complete idea of what needs to be done until the animal is anesthetized and the rads are done, and the invoice should still fall within the higher end of the range. 

When these bills come in over the estimate, does the practice owner discuss this with the client before they come in to pay, or, even better, before the extra charges are incurred? They should definitely not be leaving this conversation for receptionists or technicians to have with clients. 

If your hours are being cut because the practice is slow, I would look for another job. There is typically a predictable mild slow down in January and February, but most practices are able to combat this with Dental month promotions, and I’ve never worked anywhere that cuts employee hours for those months. Since Covid, I don’t even know if that seasonal slowdown is really applicable anymore. Most of the vets in my area are still having full schedules. I would take the combination of shady invoicing and cutting hours as red flags.|If you’re mostly doing relief work, do you actually need a DEA number?|I hope the company/companies that you are working for are covering the costs!|You can summarize a lot of of messages by just listing the questions they have, with a little bit of background or a sentence about why they are asking a specific question. The only time I leave a longer message or comm log is when clients are angry, unreasonable, or a mistake has been made that needs correcting, where I really need to document what, exactly, was said. Otherwise, my message would probably have been “o has questions about seizures and plan going forward/meds/what to look for.”  Then maybe a line about why they are calling, like “has family member with seizure disorder and wants to discuss further diagnostics” to let the person calling them back know that there is a specific reason or concern prompting the message, and prepare them to explain the differences between human medicine and veterinary medicine.|It’s squandered time and money, but if the only thing holding you back from a tech degree is an externship or a single class, you might as well do it, though your raise will likely not cover the cost of the extra class you took.|I would call Avimark.|For an assistant position I would just apply and get trained on the job. Important things to remember are to always provide water to a patient unless specifically told not to, always double leash dogs on a slip lead when walking them (most dogs can slip out of a collar and even a harness if they are trying to back away), always write down all urinations/defecations a pet has done in hospital, and never ever ever do anything that you aren’t comfortable with or haven’t been trained to do. An assistant should be doing things like restraining (when appropriately trained), cleaning the hospital, cleaning cages, and walking dogs. You can also directly help a technician or a doctor do things like get blood, place IV catheters, or take x rays, but these are not your responsibility on your own. 

Also, when making up meds, double check labels on the bottle and the label in your hand twice. 

Do not do anything with insulin, leave that to doctors and techs.

You can work towards a VTS, but it’s a lot of work and the salary increase will depend heavily on where you are working and what you are doing. I’d probably just start thinking about a new career now while you’re young.|Veterinary Technician Specialist. It’s a way to specialize in various specialty fields. In the US they are pretty respected and it does come with a raise,  but you have to be certified for at least three years before you can apply and there is a lot of work and study involved to the point where is probably more worthwhile to go to school for a different career that pays a better base salary. 

You could probably start a job search now as companies always seem more willing to invest in acquiring new employees over retaining current ones. Get in writing what your pay will increase to once your registration comes through. W|A simple card will do, and the thought will be appreciated. 

If you want to do more, a nice fruit basket is extremely considerate.|I would just look for a new job. You aren’t going to fix it.  When you leave, an email to regional management delineating what’s been going on and why you’re leaving might be effective. 

If everything else is fine and it really is just these two people, I would contact HR and regional management, *especially* if you are witnessing bullying and not the one actually being bullied. I got much not interest and a lot less gas lighting when I reached out with concerns over how another person was treated than I did with concerns about how I was being treated or how my department was being run.

Also, why are students taking out the garbage? You are there to learn, not do chores. I have never asked a student to take out the garbage.

But the good part is, it's really fun to work in the field of my special interest, and the adhd part of my brain lives for the variety and urgent cases. My days are full of cool animals, medical puzzles, and getting to connect with people about their pets - that feels amazing when it's balanced. It can be a lot when schedule stressors or disregulation hits. 

I found that making quick reference guides helps a lot for brain stress (since working memory is rough), and it can take a bit to find a clinic that's a good, solid fit.

saturnspy,"Thank you so much for your advice. It helps to have read your encouragement. I've spoken with my boss and said I need more in person support and my mental health was going downhill, and was basically told that they don't have a magic wand and can't pluck another vet from thin air, and even though they're hiring so far none of the interviewed vet applicants have agreed to take up the job. We discussed options like having more emergency consult slots and blocking off the last consult, but I was told this can only be a temporary option. I think it's quite unlikely they'll get another vet soon which is the only way to alleviate my concerns, and I'm strongly considering leaving, but am worried if I do so now it will leave bad blood between me and the practice as it would be really difficult for them if I leave now...|Thank you for your reply! My mentor is now my boss lol, so the situation has become a bit tricky. I'll definitely check the competency list, that's a great point.

ShelbyGT2024,"Sounds like there is a lot of issues with management and the team you are working with.  I can’t say when the right time is to change jobs but if there are other options and you’re not happy here, it’s perfectly reasonable to consider. 

Just wanted to add another perspective based on one thing you mentioned. At the practice I work at, it’s standard procedure to handle all paperwork and financial matters PRIOR to euthanasia. I’ve never had one single client raise an eyebrow about jt. Our CSRs always get that part out of the way first, so the owner can focus on their pet and not have to worry about anything else. No one wants to stop in the lobby to pay their bill after they’ve cried their eyes out and lost their pet. If you’re losing clients regarding this issue specifically, maybe it’s the approach that’s needs fine-tuning, not necessarily the protocol.",Veterinarian,sounds like lot issues management team working i say right time change jobs options happy perfectly reasonable consider just wanted add another perspective based one thing mentioned at practice i work standard procedure handle paperwork financial matters prior euthanasia i never one single client raise eyebrow jt our csrs always get part way first owner focus pet worry anything else no one wants stop lobby pay bill cried eyes lost pet if losing clients regarding issue specifically maybe approach needs necessarily protocol,Veterinarian

NoRelative6439,"Would a double minor aid my vet school application?

I am a freshman Animal Sciences major, and I am taking a minor in Captive Wild Animal  Management, and am trying to also fit in a Certificate of Veterinary Science (16 credits, online) Since the CWAM minor is pretty intense, (43 credits, however this is decreased with some overlap classes between my major and CWAM) I was wondering if doing all three of these at the same time would make me more competitive for vet school?

I had no idea it was illegal to administer vaccines to animals, and while I haven’t done it myself, I also can’t say I have ever actually looked into the topic. I have, however, been around others (also human doctors in the field of rescue work) who I absolutely witnessed giving injections to puppies/dogs that would come through the rescues we worked with. The vaccines from what I recall were provided by the rescue, but I may be mistaken. Otherwise I have no idea where/how the actual vaccine was obtained. On another note, I was often provided with human medications for dogs, and had to adjust dose based on weight. I assumed these meds all come from the same pharmacy and that there likely wasn’t actual differences in the meds based on human vs dog prescription.

hikeswithdogs420,"I've worked for a corporately owned vet and 2 privately owned vet hospitals, the privately owned hospitals were very different than the corporate one. I would be very hesitant to ever take a job at another corporately owned hospital as they seem to mainly just care of money - prices were higher, management was awful, pay was pretty terrible and the employee discount wasnt very great either. One of the private hospitals I worked at payed pretty well but management was terrible. Finding a smaller privately owned hospital was a God send for me, they 100% care more about the patients/clients as well as employees. It can be tough to find a non toxic work environment when your working in vet med but it's worth searching for. I was at my last hospital for 7 years and it had become very toxic, the manager would throw temper tantrums and only cared about money, including when it came down to your own personal pets. I spent about 6 months searching and asking tons of questions to potential new employers and finally found a small, privately owned practice with 100% employee discount... let me tell you, chances are if they're taking good care of their employees they're going to take good care of their patients as well.",Veterinarian,i worked corporately owned vet privately owned vet hospitals privately owned hospitals different corporate one i would hesitant ever take job another corporately owned hospital seem mainly care money prices higher management awful pay pretty terrible employee discount wasnt great either one private hospitals i worked payed pretty well management terrible finding smaller privately owned hospital god send care well employees it tough find non toxic work environment working vet med worth searching i last hospital years become toxic manager would throw temper tantrums cared money including came personal pets i spent months searching asking tons questions potential new employers finally found small privately owned practice employee discount let tell chances taking good care employees going take good care patients well,Veterinarian

fiddle_time,"I’d contact your state EDD and see what they say. Also, look into the whistleblower protections as, from what you’ve said, you took the appropriate steps to inform management about DEA violations, and then got fired. Since you’re the Tech manager, where else do you go with a problem besides the next step up the ladder?|I’m a vet. My 18 month old son went to the ER many years ago. He needed a catheter and they couldn’t get one in. Finally they called over the MD to try for a jug cath.  I asked if I could hold my son as I was a veterinarian.  They let me, to my amazement. I had hands and legs wrapped up and neck extended.  No, the doc couldn’t get the jug cath in that big old non-hairy protruding vein so they eventually got a pediatric nurse to get in a saphenous in his foot. Very interesting experience, and the staff at the ER were all great.|Talk to the Medical Director and OM if corporate. If private, talk to the veterinary owner. This is creating a hostile work environment for you and isn’t ok. They need to teach the staff how to act professionally. But, as many have said already, s**t rolls downhill and this probably started at the top, either through intention or inaction.|I worked as a groom on a race track one summer before vet school. I asked the equine vet on the track if I could shadow him for a little bit and he let me. Just ask. Worse that happens is that they say no.  I wouldn’t do LinkedIn.  Doubt you’d get a reply. Face to face is best if possible, at this stage of where you are.|Decades ago I went to Miami for a week during a vet school summer and helped out at a bird quarantine center.  It was a huge warehouse with cages of wild caught parrots, budgies, macaws, etc stacked on each other. Every morning we’d check the cages and take out the sick birds and they’d go to the clinic in the warehouse.  One morning we tube fed over 30 sick parrots and macaws.  I think they also necropsied the birds. Being a vet for that type facility might be a step Along your non-traditional pathway.|I would think there are a lot of veterinary clinics around you looking for a full time associate. In our area everyone is looking (CA).|Get a job where they agree to mentor you. That might mean the mentor vet sees fewer cases per day while you start building up your experience and communication skills. You’d probably want to start the case, then go talk to your mentor. We’re looking to hire someone, and if a new grad, that’s how I’ll set it up. You’d be pretty good in a few months to not need much help. And, there are books- with flow charts, explanations, and so on.  For surgery the mentoring would be a little different depending on who has the time. We’re planning to hire a vet I know who is partially retired to do that.|It’s wrong that you aren’t getting paid. You can get a job for a decent salary. I’d quit and go find a paying job. You’ll get experience AND get paid.|At what age should I spay/neuter my dog. 
My dog hardly ever goes outside, so he doesn’t need heartworm preventative. 
What’s the best dry food to feed my pet, and it cleans their teeth, right?|Sometimes the client talks too much, and you can waste valuable time. Controlling the narrative of the history, without squashing it, is a useful skill to develop. For example, I might interrupt, and apologize for doing so, then say I just need to get a better overview of Fluffy’s vomiting and diarrhea.  Did the diarrhea start with the vomiting 3 weeks ago, and roughly how many times per day or week.  That type of thing. 

As you get better at asking the right questions, as well as listening to the client, you’ll get a better history which can help you out with non-routine cases.  We’ve built our practice on listening to clients, and have 30-45 min appointments.  But I often don’t need all that time and will allow an urgent care to take part of a slot.|I check ears with otoscope for all routine exams. Just make it a habit and it’ll get easier. Like riding a bike.|We aren’t slow. Clients want some basic respect. Letting them know the ballpark cost can let them choose to see you or go.  We’ve always given out this type of estimate from the front desk.|Vet here. I suspect the questions were beyond what you would or should be expected to know or to answer, and it’s ok to say that a vet should answer the questions and you’ll leave a message. I, the vet, would call the (scared) client and quickly field some questions and have them make app’t. My notes would say “first seizure, disc. rules outs, set up exam. Told O to go to EC if more seizures or does not want to wait for app’t”.|I’d contact your state EDD and see what they say. Also, look into the whistleblower protections as, from what you’ve said, you took the appropriate steps to inform management about DEA violations, and then got fired. Since you’re the Tech manager, where else do you go with a problem besides the next step up the ladder?|As a new grad just get some general medicine and surgery experience first. Then in 5 years, if you’re still burnt out of the profession (not just being a student) you’ll have a good enough skill and knowledge base to do relief, house calls or whatever.|It may not be the profession. It might be depression or another medical issue. I’d take a week off to re-evaluate things, maybe see a counselor (I’m a vet).|You’ll do fine. Many vets are looking for associates. Be clear what you are looking for. Don’t sign a contract without having it reviewed. Too many times vets get stuck in a poor fit because of the contract they signed.|Salaries have risen a ton in the past 3 years. I used to try to dissuade young people from being vets, but currently, the bennies and income is good. Of course, it all depends on your vet school debts, so calculate an average expected debt load and crunch your numbers on payback amounts.|I worked in NYC as a vet a long time ago. Depending on where you live you’d want to contact the practices nearby. No need to commute an hour. Salary in NYC should be comparable to CA ( I’m in CA now).|I did an AMC internship in NY and that really really helped me. Many corporate (maybe non-corporate too) will mentor new grads. Heck, at my practice I have experienced relief vets who can only see 6 cases a day- without mentoring. I’d much rather take a new grad and mentor their 6 cases a day as I know they’ll just get better and better.|You’d go in and start the case. Then come out and ask your mentor how to proceed. Then back to the client. You’d get better and better with each case. Surgery would be mentor scrubbed in to help you initially. No “dive into the deep end” stuff.|Female GP, 2 DVM’s, CA, many years out, corp.  $130k plus 21% prod. 32 hours/wk. No on call. 5k CE, 6 wks PTO, 4 sick days, 5k matching 401k.|I have a feeling they just want you to have skin in the game to suck you dry. At 5% “ownership” you can’t make any decisions. There are a lot of 1-2 doctor practices on the market or soon to be, with few corporate buyers for even 1 million grossing small clinics. If you really want to be an owner, you should be able to pick and choose right now, and down the road.|I also once bit someone in a “situation” and got arrested.

You need to practice. FOR EFFIN REAL. 

Common questions I was asked:

1. What are your strengths?
2. What are your weaknesses? 

GET THESE TWO DOWNPACKED. You need 3 of each for strengths and weaknesses. 

3. Give an example of a time you made a mistake. What did you do after?

4. Why are you interested in this position? 

5. What qualities do you have that you believe make you fit for the _____ position?

Do yourself a favor, go online, search for a online Pinwheel where you can input as many possible interview questions as possible. You'll have to type out each and every one but then once you're down- click on it and it'll land on a random question where you'll practice answering the random question. Do this as many times as you can until you feel comfortable and can answer confidently and appropriately.

My last advice to you is to dress appropriately, speak calmly and confidently. Don't freak out if you don't know an answer to a question, but rather ask for clarification if needed and answer the BEST you can.

Treat it as a casual conversation and remember to review your resume/application so if they have any questions about it- you know what they are referring to.|This is really helpful!!

Moreover, I had four dogs (2 passed recently) and they were all big dogs. I've had pets all my life and have been the main caretaker of them always; I don't mind cleaning poop or vomit or anything lol.

nothingcommon2,"What are some options for animal experience? I know about reaching out to vets and animal hospitals, but is there anything else to be on the lookout for?|I have a handful of college credits from when I was doing dual enrollment in high school. The vast majority of these are A’s (~28 credit hours), but I’m concerned about a C in Biology 1 and a B in 2 semesters of gen chem. My overall gpa is still somewhat decent (~3.7) but I am somewhat concerned that these credits may end up dragging my gpa down. 

I understand that many people take certain classes dual enrollment, and so my situation isn’t unique. Does anyone know if admissions officers will look at these grades with a bit less scrutiny due to when I took them? Obviously I have plenty of time to boost my gpa, as well.|I recently applied to, and got a job with my university’s equestrian center primarily due to this comment.

CatladyT,I just sent an email about this and the automated reply said there is a technical issue and that they will email again when they are back available|Unfortunately no.

allthejellyfish,Basically you don't. I've been in the field for 10+ years and was almost done with my technology degree when it donned on me that I'd literally be making the same amount I was already making as an assistant. So I said screw it and got my bachelor's in wildlife biology. But I will say one thing you can do with a vet tech degree that will make decent money is working at a veterinary lab like idexx or zoetis. You typically make around 20-25 dollars depending on where you go. You aren't working directly with animals anymore but it's a good alternative to working in a clinic setting for pennies. ,Veterinarian,basically i field years almost done technology degree donned i literally making amount i already making assistant so i said screw got bachelor wildlife biology but i say one thing vet tech degree make decent money working veterinary lab like idexx zoetis you typically make around dollars depending go you working directly animals anymore good alternative working clinic setting pennies,Veterinarian

Celendiel,"Ahhh. Thank you for filling me in on this. 
I can see this idea probably won’t be an option for me. 😬. But this is why I posted - I really had no idea. It was a curiosity of mine. 

I’ve been trying to find options to get out of GP for a while but I think I may just be stuck. 😵‍💫|Ahh this is why I posted here! ☺️Thank you!|Thank you! 
I have this idea in my head because one of my former professors left academia and works for Antech.. and she gets to work from home. That sounds like heaven to me and it’s the only reason I would consider it. 

But yeah I just don’t think I can see a regular residency working for me at this point.  🤷‍♀️|USA.
