Why is it wrong to ask for advice to balance your mental health and livestyle under a heavy workload, and why does it upset you?|So you think people shouldn't ask for advice to make things better for themselves?

The conditions pet owners force their pets to live in because they're unwilling to let them go or manage their needs correctly, however... that's the hard part.

Also imo (less popular opinion) there's really no such thing as convenience euthanasia when we have such an overpopulation of pets problem. If a pet is otherwise healthy and could go to a new home, many owners are willing to surrender to a rescue if you offer to reach out for them. But when the alternative is going to an overcrowded shelter where them coming in means another animal getting pts, is that really saving anything? Idk. I come from the large animal rescue world where the lines for quality of life are drawn much differently and the barrier for entry for rescuing is much higher than small animals, but I wish the small animal communities would discuss euthanasia more practically than they often do.|Interesting!

I personally grew up around farm medicine, so fluids and gore never got me, but I had to watch a handful of spay/neuters before I stopped flinching at the scalpel lol.

Similarly, when I did my undergrad in biology, there would always be a few students who had to walk out of the first dissection lab for a bit, but by the end of the semester it was just another day 😅.

I have taken a pretty curvy road to get where I'm applying to vet school this year, so I'm about 10 years post high school where I did about 100 hours of vet clinic shadowing between two small town mixed animal clinics.

I've called both of them and they said they don't have records that far back for volunteer hours, and it's been almost 10 years so I'm sure the vets don't remember me personally after only a week of shadowing each (full days for a full week at each clinic)

I'm wondering if I can even count hours from that long ago, and if so, how does the VMCAS  verify clinic hours? Would they call the vet for verification, or need something signed? I expect both would be willing to if I sent them my documentation from the original shadowing experience, I'm just not sure what to expect.

I have taken a pretty curvy road to get where I'm applying to vet school this year, so I'm about 10 years post high school where I did about 100 hours of vet clinic shadowing between two small town mixed animal clinics.

I've called both of them and they said they don't have records that far back for volunteer hours, and it's been almost 10 years so I'm sure the vets don't remember me personally after only a week of shadowing each (full days for a full week at each clinic)

I'm wondering if I can even count hours from that long ago, and if so, how does the VMCAS  verify clinic hours? Would they call the vet for verification, or need something signed? I expect both would be willing to if I sent them my documentation from the original shadowing experience, I'm just not sure what to expect.

I recommended a dental with likely extractions for his old small breed dog with Perio 4, and he told me that it’s ridiculous to recommend extractions for teeth with just recession. I told him I’d never even imagine telling my human dentist how to practice medicine, gave him the information for a veterinary dentist in the area, and declined to schedule “just a teeth cleaning”.

I’m in an area that has a serious shortage of emergency trained vets, so much so that there’s been a pivot to regular vets not doing emergency triage, and not being able to recognize emergencies.

Is there a basic certification that’s available so that pet owners can know when it’s time for the ER?|[deleted]|[deleted]|I agree with some of the below threads. Pay varies from state and I’ve also found big cities tend to pay more than hospitals in burbs or rural areas. For instance, I’m not certified and as a tech in Boston, MA I make $27/hour but in Chicago, IL I made $23/hour. That being said, I live with my boyfriend and having dual incomes is honestly the only way I can afford to live.

I know moving for a job is a big thing consider but maybe not a bad idea to see what’s out there. I’ve also learned to not be afraid to advocate for yourself.

(Most rotations, we get there 7-8am, so we are having 10-11 hour days minimum.) Dr. C is the one who told us to absoutely tell faculty that we can leave at 6pm and it's really sad to me that when he's telling us to stand up for ourselves, that isn't true for the resident programs.

I was not a fan of school by any means. I love the profession though outside of academia.|Please lemme know to if anyone can recommend any equine vet related stuff maybe ?|Even though they count for credits.

You can always learn more by opening a book and staying sharp. You can always be improving your practices. You can work wherever you want to work. It pays great if you work hard. Love it so much. So glad I just passed navle. Can’t wait to start my career.|I don’t let others borrow my instruments. If I do, I don’t leave the room till I get them back. Everything I have was given to me by a mentor or has been through hell with me.|I stuck with vet prep. Wasn’t till the third time, that I was out of school not being forced to work in the clinic 80 hours a week making salads for tortoises or soaps for doctors that I had time to actually sleep and study. Also go to a doctor and get ur blood and hormones checked. I found out I was low testosterone and it definitely helped me pass starting TRT. I put off going to the doctor for 6 years total because of vet school. Was just too busy. But vet prep. Try to do the questions in 1 hour blocks on the timed section and then take a 20 min break. Then go back and read all the explanations. If you don’t understand something. Then go to Merck and read about it. That’s what I did.|Focus on getting into vet school first. It’s extremely difficult. Then focus on passing the courses. The course load is nothing like you’ll ever experience in ur life. They force 8 years of education down ur throat in 4 years  and then demand you pass a 360 question test on rediculous veterinary knowledge before you can get ur license. While ur on clinics you will see if you like the internship/academia approach. Dont worry about specialties now. Focus on getting in and how the f you’re gonna pay for it.|The vet schools are atrocious what they are able to get away with in the US. JUST ABOUT 130k for in state tuition, or 220k for out of state. And that doesn’t include insurance, living expenses, etc.  Every grade is based on one multiple choice test and you have to read the class notes to pass so there’s No point in going to lecture. They force you to be a glorified technician in clinics and work absurd hours because there are no regulations on student labor. During corona they abused the fuck out of us. You just wear a white coat so everyone knows you’re paying to be a slave. Go to wherever is cheapest and study like hell for navle. My school didn’t prepare me for navle. I wish I went to Germany. They just force you to assimilate to their country. Which is reasonable imo. Just difficult while learning medicine and German culture.|Atleast on the timer section. Since the test is in April there is not much time to complete the timed and not timed sections.|If you are retaking in April. Really focus on practice questions. Especially timed ones. Then read the explanations. It covers the most material and removes the time wasted you will take making guided and study materials. I used vet prep. The third time I competed it to 97 percent. I passed test this time. Maybe use zuku. I also would read a little additional in material on the questions , whether I got wrong or right on Merck veterinary manual.|I viewed vet prep not as similar to navle, but as a fun way to learn the material. It was much better to learn and read through the question format than to just read random info all day. Challenging yourself to do well and get questions right was way more fun. What was annoying was reading all the explanations but it really reinforced the information about the species and random facts you may need to know or see.|I really want you to pass. Cause waiting till next November sucks so much. It’s what I had to do. Take as many vacation and sick days from school to study. I focused too much on not failing school cause I told myself I could retake the navle for 700 but if I mess up a semester I have to pay 30k plus living expenses for a year repeat.|Focus on the power pages and the powerlectures on questions you really don’t get. Like I had to rewatch pig diarrhea and respiratory diseases 10 times. Just to understand 5 percent of it. But I’m pretty sure I got a porcine coronavirus question right because of it.|would you be willing to share where/what company? or dm me? super interested in a place where i could rotate between small exotics and emergency/iurgent care!!|Code Fred|Never too late to do what you want to do. You are only on this earth once. Do what you want. Just know vet school is full of hormonal women who aren’t married that think education and a career will fill that hole. It was a miserable time for me as a man. I just kept my mouth shut as much as a could and went home immediately from school. Found the cool guys in the class to hang with. The residents were so fuckin miserable cause they get paid next to nothing and could’ve gone right out into private practice to make tons of money. Just know you need good grades and a tough class cload to prove to you handle the demands of vet school. It is designed so that you cannot work while being vet school. They spread 8 years of education over 4 years and you are taking a new class every few weeks while 4 other classes over lap and end at random times while new ones start. Clinics you need to work against your will and your opinion means nothing and will sometimes even bother the residents if you know more. They take it as a challenge to their authority rather than you caring about the patient and the medicine; because they’re mostly women. But I would do it again. I learned a lot about women and will probably never get married.|A lot of ERs do mentorship but you'll need to ask around.

If you wanna dip ur toe- Modern Animal does some urgent care. I know they do both GP and urgent care so it's a nice mix. No clue about pay logistics etc, but this is appealing for those who wanna do a mix.

Personally would not recommend an internship! Most ERs don't care about it and have new grad type programs/mentorships that would service you faaaar better in terms of pay, experience, and overall progress. Internships where I am in California are like 70k for 80 hour weeks (including being on call nights, like maybe a week of PTO etc.). You'll probably get really proficent at surgery and very comfortable, but at what cost? New grad vets at the emergency i work at (i'm a tech there, but a vet student as well) start at 125k as new grads. They have mentorship, a schedule for being comfortable/proficent with surgeries etc. You'll get more than enough experience going straight into ER as a new grad role. I know they have something about a variety of different surgeries that needed to be signed off by a more senior doctor (watching a GI surgery, doing a GI surgery etc.)|Highly circumstance and location dependent.

I had 0 questions on anesthesia, 1 on surgery. And veterinary schools are horrible as well. I never was able to, or taught to extract one tooth during my education.

But I additionally read every answer explanation after too. I was able to quit my job and move home and study really hard.

Use the non timed questions when you’re just relaxing but take time to do 1hour sections similar to the test. I can’t tell you how much it helped my stamina and to view the test as sections rather than individual questions. It also helps you make quicker decisions on questions you don’t know so you can focus on some questions you can reason out. Just such a bad test.

Genius.|Focus on vet school first. It mostly degrades your will to want to stay in academia. It is extremely toxic. If anything, surgery alone is the best speciality because you learn how to fix things and too many vets in the field refuse to do surgery for 1 not having the time, two not being able to charge appropriately, and 3 they can make more money doing rooms. Internal medicine you can teach yourself. Also…the schools rely on radiology to do the ultrasounds where in private practice, if you want to get anything done as an internist, you need to learn how to ultrasound and interpret yourself. So I would get ur DVM. Work for a year. Then go do an ultrasonography course  where they teach you in a group how to scan. Then study internal medicine yourself. Surgery though, you really gotta do the internship residency route. You still don’t have to get boarded. But you will have to publish some bs paper and waste that time.

Is the $120K the difference in the cost of schooling itself? I think you should think of the following:

* Flights home to see family  / friends. Could cost at least $1K per trip minimum
* Cost of living (food, housing, etc.) will be a lot higher in England than Baton Rouge
* Does becoming a permanent resident or citizen of England mean anything to you? That could be a big positive for the England route
*  Investigate immigration status in England. Sometimes study permits don't allow you to qualify for national health insurance scheme. Might be more $ for a private insurance plan or a school sponsored plan

And many more nuances that come with international moving. With that said, only you can decide if it's worth it. I find it sometimes helps to flip the question: If you were planning to go to England for vet school and someone said ""I'll pay you $120K to go to LSU instead, all else being equal"", would you do it?|You are welcome! The opportunity to live abroad might never come back around for you, so if you don't go now, you'll have to be sure you can live with ""what might have been""|Hi! Wildlife rehabilitation/rescue has become my life’s passion.

Couple things you have to know
- you want to find GOOD rehab centers to learn from. Well funded and highly professional. Not one where nobody is monitoring volunteers and animals can get killed on accident from carelessness. It’s more than them having a good vet- it’s gotta be the way it’s run
- it is a very very high amount of euthanasia and that’s not for everybody. My brain sees it as a treatment for the untreatable and giving them respect/peace and am grateful for it. But I can’t do pet euthanasias emotionally 🤷🏼‍♀️ everyone’s different
- it’s not rolling in money. A good one will pay decent but you’re not gonna be rich
- you will have to cut open dead rats, bunnies, and other and sometimes break their bones to make portions for raptors and scavengers
- depending on the animal, you can get hurt but if you’re doing ur job right it won’t be severe. Just bites/scratches. It’s only a problem with rabies vectors but idk any professional who’s gotten bit and you have to have the vaccine to be able to work with them
- some days ur gonna get gross, that’s what scrubs are for
- some animals will have parasites on their body and they will often crawl up your arm or you find them a few hours later bc they’re so little. It’s feather lice primarily bc ticks are usually attached and feather lice will fall off in a day or two bc we don’t have feathers but that is the main thing I do not like. Nobody told me and then I found some on my arm or leg and was like “where is this coming from”

Some people can work in education for rehab centers that have resident animals that cannot be released into the wild. This is sometimes controversial but everywhere I’ve worked has had them|Wish I could say the same as a wildlife specialty 😅😅😭😭 but the joy I get is worth it|😂|You have SO much time. I completely switched my animal focus and my entire path. Some people go to vet school years after they graduate college. Go get a degree in animal science or zoology IMO. You’re gonna have to deal with mainly not working with animals everyday for undergrad unless you’re working- it will get you to your goal in the long run.|That’s what I wish I did instead of a directly vet focused undergrad.

Taught in poland, practiced in UK but noone said anything about me going flank|I think the people that do this generally do wildlife biology as undergraduate degrees and maybe get an additional master's in wildlife biology first. You will not get ANY training on wildlife in vet school. Being a zoo/exotics/wildlife vet requires you to be a comparative biologist. Take what we know/have for domestics and apply to the species you're working on. A lot of fact finding for papers to get protocols, etc... So having more knowledge of that work prior to your vet school experience will help you. It's a small field and hard to break into. If you're thinking capture and immobilization of let's say bears for research a lot of that is done with PhD's so maybe get in touch with a school that has a wildlife department and talk out best steps. If you're thinking rehabilitation, then you're typically doing that work on the side. If you're thinking zoo then you'll generally need a residency after vet school.|I work with wildlife so I don’t have to interact with owner ethics (thank god) but I remember in practice interviews in school they would give us situations like these and ask what we would do- very interesting discussion!|Just passed navle here. Took me three tries. I can’t tell u how brutal first and second year were because of anatomy and the lecture load. I felt the same. I would get a D and study harder only to get a C-. Once I realized this is not a test of intelligence, these vet school tests are a test of memory I stopped caring so much and just make it about memory. You have to find ways to memorize shit with mneumonjcs and stuf that your brain wants to remember. Just know it’s there to prepare you for the amount of BS you need to force urself to study for navle. It may have 0 use in the clinic but some people believe it all makes sense by graduation; The anatomy first year, then pathology second year, clinics 3rd year, and electives 4th year with some more clinics.  By the end it all makes sense together. Vet medicine is a monster. Idk where I’d start with teaching. I just wish we didn’t need to focus on all that large animal bs. Such a waste of time. Just with clinics, keep ur mouth shut and pretend ur dumb. Most residents and interns will see you as a challenge to their authority if you make recommendations better than them. Atleast in my experience. What I really really learned from vet school was where to look up information and how to back up what I wanted to do medically with sound medical reasoning.|Push you to ur limits of studying random information against ur will.

In my second job, we were salaried with no production incentive, but of course they tracked production. It was fun to compare, and interesting in that all of the ER docs had almost identical production. But then…they changed it so that we couldn’t see our production.

In the stalls we had regular stall mats and they were sealed with a rubber caulk material (I had to reseal them once when I teched there). The other equine clinic I worked at had the same thing but in the year I worked there I never saw anyone pull them and clean underneath...god only knows what was growing under there.

For the cats, I can sometimes make it work depending on the cat. For the lunging dogs, nope.|Was working about 60 hrs/week in ER/ICU when I decided it was now or never. I was CRAZY into my job, loved the intensity, the level of medicine, the focus on learning, and the great team I was a part of. But I was 33, knew I wanted more than one kid, and didn’t want to have kids when I was over forty.
And so it began - the shift from a full throttle ER/ICU vet, to a full throttle mom of five fantastic kids whom I ended up homeschooling for 9 years (7 years before Covid hit.).
It began with a miscarriage during an overnight shift - fun times - then five babies in a span of 5.5 years (no twins.)
I went back to work after 3 months for the first and second, but worked weird hours (like 6 hour shifts) so that I would spend most of the days with them. After my fifth, I took a year off.
My two oldest kids, now 21 and 20, were reminiscing recently about how sad they used to be when I went to work, because they felt like they wouldn’t see me again forever.
One day I came home and found my oldest kid, about 7 at the time, missing an eyebrow. Dad - apparently my sixth child- had bet him $22 that he wouldn’t shave off an eyebrow. He did. Every time I worked, it seemed, stuff would happen.
One day I was just leaning in to intubate an unconscious, cyanotic Pomeranian when I was paged. My husband was calling from the back of an ambulance, on the way to the hospital with my son who was gushing blood out his ear. (Backstory: Apparently he and his brother had been pretending to be dinosaurs by putting Q-tips in their ears, and jumping on the bed. Little guy fell on the bed, on the Q-tip, and of course it ruptured his ear drum and had to be surgically repaired with a graft. But I digress.)
Anyway, while leaning over that blue dog, chanting to my panicking self, “First save the dog. You can’t change the ambulance situation” was the moment I realized I just had to be home.
I took several years off except for a rare relief shift. When I started back, I had lost 99% of my confidence. It was awful and it was terrifying.
I’m 100% glad I was home with my kids while they were young but it’s almost a miracle that I had the guts to return.
If I had it to do over, I guess I would have made it a point to do like one shift a month.
I started back by doing some vaccine clinics (shhh), then GP relief, then back to ER.  When my youngest got to high school age, I took on more shifts, but I still usually work shorter shifts (9-4, 4-11) because I want to be around for them. I do relief only so that I can schedule work around every one of their hockey games and saxophone performances. I refuse to miss ANYthing they do!
My focus is 100% my kids. No longer my career. Don’t get me wrong - I’m super diligent and thorough with work when I work - but I work because it’s what I do with my time when my kids don’t need me.
Having a baby will change your career, but there is nothing wrong with that. It doesn’t make it worse, just different.
Good luck!|I wrote a long reply to OP, but want to share my experience with you. I had 5 kids in 5.5 years, and never went back full time. I was (and am) all-in as a parent.
My one regret is that I ended up taking a few years off while I was homeschooling four of my five (long before covid.)  Those homeschooling years were the absolute BEST, but to return to practice after that was terrifying because I had lost all confidence in my ability. If you do take time away, consider doing a relief shift once a month or so, just to keep that door open.|I hear ya on all that!

I feel confident about pursuing this as a career, it’s just the finances that worry me. I’m first gen and don’t come from a lot of money. I’ll be the first one in my family to navigate college in the US. Thank you again for your input and advice. Im so appreciative!!!|This is exactly what I needed to hear thank you. I’ll definitely look into this. I didn’t know certain jobs would help with loans. Thank you so much!!!!|yes, you should wear gloves. It is a chemical burn.

Lots of veggies and a protein shake.
2. Pack fun beverages. Infused water, kombucha, a special sparkling water, whatever gives you a little happy dopamine boost. (Doesn’t have to be chocolate!)

4. Recently I was having motivation problems, partly related to knee surgery and being unable to make progress like I used to. I hired a personal trainer. Part of the reason is to try to correct my deficits. But a bigger part of the reason was I needed someone to report to, someone to hold me accountable!
5.

Going corporate has sucked the soul out of every clinic I know that's sold out, and left the entire staff overworked, underappreciated, and burnt out.

When my fiance's (tech) clinic went corporate things went downhill fast. A bunch of their best employees went to the office to tell them if something didn't change soon they were all leaving. The corporate solution? Creating a ""head tech"" position with extra responsibility and no pay raise. 2/3 of the employees in that meeting quit within the month.|All corporate buyouts are bad. Even if a company is smart enough not to try to fix what isn't broken, everytime a faceless profit-driven entity takes over a small privately owned business the entire community loses. This is not exclusive to veterinary medicine.|My fiance got better pay and benefits moving to a private practice after her clinic went corporate.

Even if there are temporary boons to a select few people, it's not worth the overall harm that corporate takeovers do to the profession, individual clinic cultures, and local communities.

Corporations are not our friends, and even if they write your check they do not care about you. Don't push their talking points for them.|If you leave vet school is it hard to get into another one? (Mental health reasons)|The only people that worked in vet school did a Saturday shift as a VA at a vet hospital during the school year. It was maybe only 2-3 people. You should not expect to work. It's more than a full-time job.|Vet prep should tell you where you're struggling... Focus there. Also rest, eat well, go outside.|At my clinic it was required that two people initial the bottle. So the person filing it would bring the label, the original bottle and the Rx bottle with meds to have someone else check them. Two signatures were checked by the CSR before being given to the client.

If you're going for an appointment (new prescription), do this with the DVM ... ""Hey doc, can you review this prescription before I go over it with the owner?"" Tell the doctor you're always paranoid you've done it incorrectly so they know why. Initial the bottle. Have them initial the bottle. Always bring the original bottle of medication from the pharmacy with you to check for label and pill matching.

In general:
Right drug, right dose, right route, right time, right patient. Never set anything down without a label (especially injectable). If you're filling two do one completely before opening the next bottle.|[deleted]|Their service is overloaded, it can't cope with the demand put on it, making the back end fail all the time, one of their people said as much 2 days ago|No, you're not wasting your time, but I will say your screenshot shows that not a lot of bandwidth being used, and you have only had the node session active for less than 24 hours, so you should really give it more time.

If I buy 1k in myst to stake into my node to earn 10 Dai a day, I could potentially  lose it all on price fluctuations. I also may not earn it if my node is not used to its capacity. But I cannot earn more than 10dai a day if I don't have that initial investment of 1k myst.

And there is no guarantee that the next step is suddenly 10k myst minimum.

Am I understanding this correctly?|You got an eta yet or is apple doing your head in with their process of AppStore listing 😂|I can't believe Bittrex is pulling this crap.

>Really makes no sense, especially after the recent pump, you'd think trading volume would be up and that would be a positive for an exchange.

Its not about volume, its about their new policy to try and comply with US securities exchange laws, Bittrex is trying to avoid getting wrecked by the SEC.

They are delisting all coins and tokens that 1. pay dividends or 2. have no use outside of trading. Mysterium has no use, since the Mysterium network does not currently exist.|[deleted]|[deleted]|Im seeing the same thing as you.

TL;DR Either the volume was too low, or more likely, compliance issues. This has recently happened to a couple other tokens, with bittrex requesting additional documentation from them. It appears like bittrex is trying to make sure it is SEC compliant, and delisting things until they can provide documentation proving they are not just unregistered securities. |Yes, I need a answer too. |theres DEXs too, paradex, ethfinex, bitshares we could all get into..not sure how that works though",Comment too long

I do have some questions, hope you don't mind me asking.


**Team:**


* Can you tell us something about the team? How many people are currently working at Mysterium?


**Community:**


* Do you think the community members and backers of Mysterium are important and why?
* How do you think Mysterium can improve to get the community more involved?


**Networking:**
Mysterium was on the foreground raising awareness in the Ethereum community by building this important piece of tech, a decentralized VPN network. After the fundraising Mysterium went mysteriously quiet. Nowadays, barely anyone from the Ethereum community or the Web3foundation knows about you guys. Which is sad because many of them are located in Berlin where Mysterium is based as well.

I remember Robert visited Devcon a few years ago in Cancun. The other Devcons, ETHBerlin, DAPPcon…. You guys were just not there.


* Is there any particular reason why Mysterium stays absent at major, important events?
* And do you think it should be improved and how?
* Do you think networking is important?

**Tokenomics:**

As far as I know, the decision making about what role MYST tokens have inside Mysterium mainly took place internally in the team. The community was never involved.


* What different token models did you explore or study?
* How do you think the current model will create value for MYST?
* Will MYST tokens have a governance role in the future?
* Did you explore any staking contract models?
For example, where every MYST token transaction pays a tiny amount of fee to a staking contract. The one who stakes more is collecting more fees.
* Will Mysterium create a MYST liquidity pool on Uniswap in the future? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/gc3zxw/ama_jaro_šatkevic_head_of_product_9_am_est_5th/fpjlt4h/",Comment too long

ARatNamedClydeBarrow,"As a VA, this makes me so sad for you. Yeah it takes you guys some time to hit your stride, but that’s the same for *everyone*. I would never dream of speaking to a DVM that way. Voicing concerns in a respectful manner and having a discussion is one thing, but to talk to you with such derision is absolutely not okay. It’s far past time for a chat with their supervisor / head doc / PM.

I love my new grad doctors so much! They always like to talk things out with me (I love hearing the trains of thought) and even sometimes ask my opinion if it’s not something they’re super familiar with, but is something I’ve seen before. They love to teach us things they learned in school, it helps solidify concepts for them *and* we probably get to learn something new. I’m losing one of my new grads and I’m super broken up about it, I switched my dog to her when she started and now he doesn’t have a vet.

Some advice for emergencies: even if you’re not comfortable taking the lead, if you’re not occupied doing other things then try to get involved and make yourself useful - for CPR scenarios offer to count or breathe, if you’re comfortable with it restraint for IVC placement, getting hot or cold packs as needed, grabbing supplies for a u cath, pulling out emergency drugs, etc. This way you can observe what the more experienced DVM on the case is doing without hovering too much or getting in the way - biggest thing here though is to know when to ask questions, and when to shut up (don’t go into a full differential while the main doc is trying to interpret rads, for example… you most likely will get yelled at lol). My newest new grad likes to be a “fetus tech” (his words) and help out for little things if he has the time, and tries to be helpful during emergencies if he’s available because he feels it makes him a better doctor.|I learned this extremely quickly when I started working ER. I now carry this phrase like a shield and I have to frequently remind my poor new grad DVMs in GP to remember this because I see how much it hurts them when the clients don’t want to listen.|As a VA, this makes me so sad for you.

Some advice for emergencies: even if you’re not comfortable taking the lead, if you’re not occupied doing other things then try to get involved and make yourself useful - for CPR scenarios offer to count or breathe, if you’re comfortable with it restraint for IVC placement, getting hot or cold packs as needed, grabbing supplies for a u cath, pulling out emergency drugs, etc. This way you can observe what the more experienced DVM on the case is doing without hovering too much or getting in the way - biggest thing here though is to know when to ask questions, and when to shut up (don’t go into a full differential while the main doc is trying to interpret rads, for example… you most likely will get yelled at lol).

Hi, after doing some changes and test, now I'm getting different errors in the logs (and of course, VPN client neither connect).

Updated docker run command:

```bash
docker run --cap-add NET_ADMIN -d -p 7500-7700:7500-7700 -p 4449:4449 --name myst -v /volume2/virtualization/docker/mysterium-node:/var/lib/mysterium-node --device /dev/net/tun:/dev/net/tun  mysteriumnetwork/myst:latest service --agreed-terms-and-conditions
```

I have to run wireward in another docker and link to the main docker? I found no information related to this...


I'm running this on a synology, where the port 5000 is used by DSM and seems that tries to use it (i can change it, but why is happening?):

```bash

I've solved it, but not just doing that (I had some ports in the middle), I've just reduced the port range even more than yours and did some changes in the docker.

How do you see it on your wallet tho? When I put the transaction ID on etherscan nothing shows. Even when I put my wallet address on etherscan I still can't see any transactions.

I check my metamask wallet and I don't see any myst either. But when I check the node it gives me a Transaction Id with the date and time. Where did the tokens go?|Okay.

EDIT:

So when I go to Bridge section in Metamask, It gives me an option to transfer tokens from one network to another.

When I select Polygon (From this network) I can see my MYST tokens around 4 MYST tokens which is about a dollar.

But when I click the Metamask extension on google chrome I do not see any myst tokens. All I see is

I have AdGuard Home setup on my pi zero, I guess I can check the traffic thru there thank you for the advice.

https://docs.mysterium.network/faq|You should not have any problems if you turn ""Public"" off. My node has been up for 1 month and never had any problems yet.

Second, I also want to turn Public on but I have to read and understand very well on ""how to run an exit node"" https://dvpnalliance.org/exit-node/

This is their original guide on how to run an exit node.

There are deffinitely  important information in that guide.|How are you able to reach 50-100 MYST with one node?|Hmm. Okay I appreciate the answer. Its been 11 hours and 58 minutes. Only 2.87MB used. That's very interesting.|I did a clean pi OS installation and it seems to be working normal right now. Made 5 mysts in the past 4-5 days.

How do you see it on your wallet tho? When I put the transaction ID on etherscan nothing shows. Even when I put my wallet address on etherscan I still can't see any transactions.

I check my metamask wallet and I don't see any myst either. But when I check the node it gives me a Transaction Id with the date and time. Where did the tokens go?|Okay. Thank you|the external address is the same as my metamask wallet address. I didn't do anything specific. Do I need to do anything specific?

When I log into metamask I only see; ETH wallet address that is it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

EDIT:

So when I go to Bridge section in Metamask, It gives me an option to transfer tokens from one network to another.

When I select Polygon (From this network) I can see my MYST tokens around 4 MYST tokens which is about a dollar.

But when I click the Metamask extension on google chrome I do not see any myst tokens. All I see is

0 ETH.

&#x200B;

EDIT 2:

Somehow I managed to do it. I went to metamask portfolio then I select Bridge. Over there I clicked ""Switch networks in Metamask"" > Then I select Polygon. After that I was able to see it in my portfolio. I clicked Myst in my portfolio then I clicked ""Add to metamask""

Now I am able to see my Myst tokens in metamask.|As long as public is off. You should be fine. The rest, you can leave it on.|No, your node is online and running.

justforyouTM,"I have 50000 to 60000 udp change it in settings and router. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/137fcnb/new_to_this_i_just_wanna_have_reassurance_and/jixryxz/ | If you go to the website where u can view the nice status and all. There are settings which u can adjust accordingly.

U could be connected with upnp which is normal, but I would recommend switching that and manually forward you router firewall rules. (Ports 50000,60000) in this case. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/137fcnb/new_to_this_i_just_wanna_have_reassurance_and/jj2hrah/ | What do you mean its not recognize port interval?

Depending on your router you can specify a port range usually something like 50000-60000 will work but sometimes it uses a ~ or some other. check your model for that info.

Probably not all traffic. But check that on site. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/137fcnb/new_to_this_i_just_wanna_have_reassurance_and/jj2kvpv/ | To my knowledge there is no limit, only thing is the bandwidth limit I guess.

Port 4449 or something. There you can adjust things like the UDP port range to use.

It can be hard, and I struggled initially, but eventually you learn how to cope. Fortunately, I’ve seen enough positive research results that help to justify the practice and foster an appreciation for the necessity of animal models.

There are still the occasional cases that get to me, and I think it is healthy to allow yourself to feel these losses to a certain degree, as you don’t want to become entirely desensitized. We all came into the career because we love animals, it’s natural to feel distress at times- learning healthy coping mechanisms is essential. The animals are always under anesthesia or sedated prior, so in most situations the experience is not traumatic for the animal. It is also helpful to have supportive staff/management- I know this isn’t always common in vet med, but it is truly helpful when there is collaboration and attention to compassion fatigue.|In four years you’ll still be four years older, so might as well pursue what you want to do.

I’m in the process of taking post bac classes to improve GPA and it is taking a really long time, with how competitive vet school has gotten I don’t think my experiences will ever outweigh someone with moderate experience but higher gpa. It may, but is unlikely.

There are other fields you can pursue to make more money and still stay within the realm rather than working as an assistant in GP. Depending on what your degree is in, you could do pharmaceuticals, research, lab animal. You could also leave the field entirely so you can make more money, and use your free time to volunteer/shadow to gain additional vet experience.|As someone who’s worked as an assistant/tech with many vets, I would NEVER call a vet by their first name unless they had specifically asked me to.

PresentationFuzzy658,Honestly I had a nurse come into our clinic and it was the most annoying incident ever. She made so many complaints and then complained at how she was a nurse who worked night shifts and didn’t have time for whatever “mistake” we made. She basically had a card decline on a monthly payment and was FURIOUS. I left her multiple voicemails that we would eat that payment and rectify things and she never called back. Apparently her job is just so extremely important and she’s too busy to call the clinic back idrc. But yeah they all have some sort of entitlement/god complex. Some guy even claimed to be a neurosurgeon (he was a PA in neurology) my least favorite clients are healthcare workers of stature like Nurse/PA/MD they just love to tell everyone their title. I met some who were really nice those are usually the MD but yeah that’s my two cents that no one asked for 🥲,Other
