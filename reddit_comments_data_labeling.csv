Mediocre-Jelly-7625,"Hi yes thank you, I did get a few interviews where they said that they would be unable to hire me for only 3 1/2 months, which was kinda upsetting since I already stated that in my cover letter and they just made me sit through an interview. I reached out to many vet clinics for shadowing experiences since I was in high school and none of them want people to shadow. I don't know what to do because I need veterinary hours. So far I only have around 330 hours in animal experience."
vetgee,"Specialists can easily make 300-500k a year these days. So no, it is not that bad.|Doesn’t sound that bad to me.|Whoever told you that is missing a lot of info|They’re just mad they’re stuck living and working in the middle of nowhere Indiana.

Our prices are so low i can just barely gross over a million a year, and my volume is capped by having to share surgery days with surgeons. It’s beyond frustrating.|No I have to share with surgeons who quote “have seniority”. It’s a joke.|1|From what I’ve seen (specialists at a huge er/specialty hospital on east coast) VEG is notorious for running up giant invoices quickly then not referring to a specialist in time and having the owners show up with no $ left. Super frustrating. They’re good at social media but the actual medicine leaves something to be desired. Just my opinion.|Sounds like every vet hospital|I would probably stick it out just to give yourself the option of practicing when you’re done. If you’re torn on career options maybe consider moonlighting as an er vet. You can easily clear 300k a year working er these days.|Vet for 14 years here.

This is probably going to be the first of about 20 things your boss does that concern you in this or similar ways. After thing #7 or so you’ll start realizing you need to change jobs."

Stellatebasketcase,"Totally fine to wear a respirator if that makes you feel most comfortable but also fine to go without. Avoiding risks of exposure like extubation, ensuring the scavenger system is working well, and having someone check for leaks occasionally. I work at a large specialty hospital and two of our anesthesiologists have been pregnant while working, and neither wore respirators. I didn’t either, and was just careful about limiting exposure."

veracosa,"Vet med is a passion, and while you *can* make decent money, that isn't the reality for many who have average debt and are paying it off traditionally. The new vet school in Puerto Rico was quoting like 70K per semester. holy shit. I cannot imagine paying half a million dollars for a degree

I graduated with 208K debt in 2014 and I'm still bitching about that...

The job itself is what you make of it. Find what you like, and people you like doing it with. Sometimes where (as in town, location) can be just as important. Working in a low income area was, for me, too limiting and depressing as a GP. For others it might be a welcome challenge and way to work with the local community.

I also find that on average, the hardest years are the first 1-3. Many of my colleagues struggled until they found a good fit and started to get more experience.|We have a bunch of the macroview ones at my work and I can't use them at all. I have to use the old school ""operating"" type

rjsevin,"Just because you need a vet in a rural area doesn't mean that graduating additional students will get one there. Rural jobs are not desirable. The salaries are lower, the hours are usually longer and harder as they are typically large animal with lots of on call hours, the areas you are forced to live in to accommodate the job are not great for young professionals looking to maybe find a life partner and, if they desire, raise a family...

I'm not saying one way or another about if more schools are needed, I don't have an educated opinion, but I don't necessarily see more graduates as an effective way to get people to rural locations.|I also work for the feds after being in small animal private practice for 6 years. The change has been nothing but a breath for fresh air and I'm really thriving in the new position. A couple years in and I'm still loving it.|Without an MPH (I don't have any advanced degrees besides my DVM) you're going to be looking at GS-11/12 positions, which are basically entry level DVM positions. As far as I know, most departments that hire vets are basically running on fumes and desperate for applicants.

Mostly, my advice if you want a fed job is be willing to move and be willing to take a pay cut. Unless you already live near a work hub you're going to have to move. And the pay cut... If you learn your job and work hard, there are lots of opportunities for promotions. Less than 18 months after starting I was promoted to a GS-13 position, which is closer to a reasonable private practice salary in my area.

I'm happy to expand further if you want to shoot me a message."

IntrepidOption2635,"I would be happy to answer questions along the way, I am from the US though so may not be as helpful with certain questions having to do with that.|It is definitely possible, I know a decent amount of vets who started in other careers. In terms of getting in to vet school you will have to take the pre-req courses(chemistry, biochem, orgo, ect) but no specific degree is required so you just need to complete those courses. A full list can be found on most vet school websites. It is good you have volunteering experience with shelters but you may want to find a way to get more experience directly with veterinarians as well. In my experience schools seem to like applicants who are arebswitching carreers. It wouldn't hurt to reach out the admissions office of some schools you're interested in and just ask as well. Good luck, hope to see you in the field.|I would be happy to answer questions along the way, I am from the US though so may not be as helpful with certain questions having to do with that.|Hello, I am a current 4th year vet student who shares your passion for surgery. It is a long journey. The bare minimum requirements to become a boarded surgeon are achieving your DVM, one year of a rotating internship after vet school graduation, and a 3-year residency. This is easier said than done, and it's not uncommon to have to do multiple internships (known as specialty internships, these would be one year programs that are surgery focused) before getting a residency. During your surgery residency you will be required to take two board exams, and you have to publish at least one paper in a veterinary journal. It's never too early to start gaining surgical experience. A good place to start would be a local shelter that does high volume spay/neuters; they're typically always looking for volunteers. If you have any additional questions I'd be happy to answer.|Not a dumb question. As a rule of thumb it is not ideal. Usually 30-60k a year. It depends on where you go. Private internships and residencies pay more in general like 60-80k but academic is much lower, like 20-50k."

But the big difference is that Americans have severe student debt, whereas if you’re Australian, HECS is a much more forgiving system.

A smallies vet friend is 3 years out, on 92K. Hope that helps.|New grad here. My honest opinion is, if you’re passing, you know enough. The first few years of the veterinary degree are honestly extremely irrelevant to clinical practice. I remember being in 3rd year (5 year degree), and seeing practice questions from a 4th year friend, and nearly having a panic attack. The further along in the degree, the more “clinically relevant” the content becomes, and it has a way of making you think you are lightyears away from your colleagues when in fact they are only slightly ahead of you in the degree. 

The other thing to consider is how long your colleagues have been working in clinics for; it makes a huge difference when you start seeing real life patients presenting over and over again for the same common things like skin/ear disease and vomiting/diarrhoea (assuming you’re in a small animal clinic). If you have access to patient records, read them! Try to grasp the vet’s process of diagnosis and their treatment plan. 

In terms of resources/books, are there any particular topics you’re concerned about? I found the MiniVet Guide (by Gerardo Poli) to be quite helpful, especially the Radiology Flashcards that you can purchase as an add-on. As you get into final year, I also highly recommend reading the ACVIM consensus statements for IMHA, MMVD, etc.

The further along in the degree, the more “clinically relevant” the content becomes, and it has a way of making you think you are lightyears away from your colleagues when in fact they are only slightly ahead of you in the degree. 

The other thing to consider is how long your colleagues have been working in clinics for; it makes a huge difference when you start seeing real life patients presenting over and over again for the same common things like skin/ear disease and vomiting/diarrhoea (assuming you’re in a small animal clinic). If you have access to patient records, read them! Try to grasp the vet’s process of diagnosis and their treatment plan. 

In terms of resources/books, are there any particular topics you’re concerned about? I found the MiniVet Guide (by Gerardo Poli) to be quite helpful, especially the Radiology Flashcards that you can purchase as an add-on. As you get into final year, I also highly recommend reading the ACVIM consensus statements for IMHA, MMVD, etc.

Best of luck!|That’s a great idea. I would recommend signing up for a Plumb’s membership (it’s discounted for students!!) and reading up on common drugs that you come across in practice!|In regard to vet nursing - it depends on the state. To my knowledge, Victoria and Queensland are a bit more loose with the term “vet nurse”. In Western Australia it is quite strict. A lot of larger clinics only recruit “registered” vet nurses, while smaller clinics may hire and train you as an unregistered nurse. I will say they are beginning to tighten up on this. You need to complete a Certificate IV (2 year diploma) TAFE course in most states to register, and it can be quite competitive.|Hi. Australian new grad here - I have relocated overseas but can tell you most of my classmates are making 70K-80K in small animal practice. A few less fortunate folks are on 65-68K. Corporate small animal clinics are were all offering low 70s. Mixed practice new grads with after hours seem to be on 75-85K. 

A mixed vet who is 2 years out is on 105K with no after hours.
A smallies vet friend is 3 years out, on 92K. Hope that helps.|Just letting you know - the pay in Australia is MUCH worse than the US. I’m a new grad vet in Australia; most of my classmates are on $65-75K AUD. There was a thread recently about salary transparency; seems like the US salary is more than double, and obviously USD. But the big difference is that Americans have severe student debt, whereas if you’re Australian, HECS is a much more forgiving system. I will say though - the journey to vet school is uniquely challenging; every vet school requires you to submit evidence of animal/veterinary experience, and you’ll need extremely good grades from your last degree to be even considered.

Sufficient_Daikon_59,"I’m not a vet, but my father is so although I can’t speak on the direct impact, I’ve seen/witnessed it.

It’s definitely an emotionally taxing job, but you already know that. There’s times my dad has come home from work and we won’t really be able to talk to him because he’s upset from something from work, for example, having to witness children’s agony upon learning about their sick pet. 

Other times he will come home with over-the-top gifts from people whose animals he saved. 

I guess from how I see it, being a vet is being a hero. That’s your job. People will expect that of you, and if you can’t provide it they may be extremely angry and cruel because they expected you to fix everything. But if you can, they will be grateful beyond grateful."
YoudBeSurprised,"This isn’t very specific, but you should look for jobs in industry. Diagnostic companies, pet food companies, insurance, etc. DVMs can get those jobs but you’ll probably need to go out of your comfort zone|You definitely want to study. Read through the materials online, make an outline if that is a way you can study. I took it just a few months ago and did fine.

It’s now an online test and you have three hours to take it. No need for a test center. And no one is stopping you from having notes available, for what it’s worth. There’s a lot of common sense stuff ultimately like what are exclusively vet responsibilities and what aren’t, but there’s more specific material too like years you need to keep records, how to dispose of remains in municipal land, etc."
Deepbluwaters,"Vet tech and practice manager here: actually go to the hospital with a resume in hand!!  If you don’t know how to write up a resume get online and learn!!  It should be 2 pages or less since you have no previous vet experience.  My motto is “if you’re too lazy to pound the pavement you’re too lazy to work in vet medicine”.  I realize I’m old and times have changed but if you are able to go out and visit the hospitals do so!!  You might see something in person that makes you realize that particular clinic is not a fit for you.  
I never reply to someone just inquiring over the phone, that shows no initiative.  At the least, send a nice email with your resume attached. Once the resume is submitted call or stop in within 2 weeks as a follow up. 
Research the hospitals, if they have a ton of turnover that’s a red flag. 
Best of luck to you!!"
throwawaytogetaway20,"They denied my Form 2 when I sent it in before the date of my degree being awarded. They stated they will consider the application after my degree is officially awarded.

There are 18-19 year olds, which will form the majority of course but on the 4 year program, they will be your age|as an aside, being on the student visa in the UK you have full access to the National Health Service (NHS) which would mean if anything were to happen, you can access universal healthcare.|Hey! I’m a Canadian that went to an AVMA uni (Edinburgh) after high school. My total tuition canadian was around 225000 CAD. They are eligible for Canadian student loans|I was referring to Canadian Government Student Loans|They’re the Canadian Student loans. They administered by the Federal and Provincial govt. I applied for mine on Student Aid BC but it’ll be different if you’re from another province|Fair! Just wanted to provide OP with info that they are eligible for govt loans as many ppl (including many Canadians I attended vet school with) do not know that an international uni is eligible for those grants/loans. Totally understandable that an international education isn’t accessible to everyone. Recall that, this investment in an education that can bring you to being a licensed vet faster (going from Canadian high school to vet school in europe) will have a better ROI. I am a vet at 23. I have saved countless years trying to apply for vet school after my bachelors. The minimum I’ve saved is 2 years (3years bachelors with 4 year DVM) as my degree was 5 years. I am making an income now to pay down my loans. I want other 17/18 year olds to know that a Canadian Bachelors to DVM is not the only route. That heading to the UK to become a vet is an option as well. With this in mind, taking out loans with higher interest rates might prove beneficial with this financial picture in mind"

f4un4,"great advice in this comment section so far! for context i am a ""lead"" veterinary assistant. i essentially got this position by being a jack of all trades at my hospital (we also don't have many CVT's haha, otherwise i am sure there would be a lead technician). don't undervalue things like reception and customer service. learn both the front of house (reception) and back of house (technician) operations. 

honestly it is evident that you are eager to learn-- make sure that your team can also see this same enthusiasm! you are going to do great!  now, not every moment can be a ""teaching moment"", i ask questions as much as i can but i also learned to read the room and know when it was inappropriate for me to ask questions, and rather just help how i can, which frequently means simply restraining the animal and/or monitoring. there is going to be a lot to learn and it will feel like a lot at once, just know that there's definitely a learning curve and you will totally get past it. with each day of experience, you will get better (even if you don't realize!). sure, there were some things i had to go out of my way to study but a lot of what i know came from experience and getting used to the routine of the clinic.

learning your flea and heartworm prevention is huge imo, helping people understand that fleas and heartworms actually can enter gated communities (yup, somebody said that once) and understanding which kind is best for their lifestyle. obviously, follow the guidance of the dr. but frankly techs and assistants have a LOT to do with client education as well, as typically we are the ones who go over patient histories and treatment plans/estimates.

i would also say it is important to learn how to run labs pretty quickly. no one is going to be expecting you to place IV catheters or do blood draws on day one, but to be able to go run things on the machine and/or read the cytology will be super useful. 

one of the few things i had to really study as opposed to learn through experience was the drugs used during surgeries. pre-op/induction drugs vs post-op vs emergency drugs. mainly what you need to know is how what drugs the vet uses will affect your patient, for example some cause bradycardia, some cause them to wake up really hard, etc. this will be important to know if you are monitoring patients, which, not to worry, I don't think they will throw you into!!

anyway, sorry for the yap fest. this is an awesome job and an awesome field. it is hard, don't get me wrong. but you will connect with so many pets and so many people. i am at a point where i have a rapport with pets and their families and it just means the world to me.|i am so happy to hear that your cat made it <3

one of the few things i had to really study as opposed to learn through experience was the drugs used during surgeries. pre-op/induction drugs vs post-op vs emergency drugs. mainly what you need to know is how what drugs the vet uses will affect your patient, for example some cause bradycardia, some cause them to wake up really hard, etc. this will be important to know if you are monitoring patients, which, not to worry, I don't think they will throw you into!!

Dry-Cartographer7591,"A couple of guidelines I have been taught are: 

•Basically you want to show your interest by researching each school’s program, finding out what you can, and asking about what interests you, what concerns you might have, what might make that school a better opportunity or a better fit for you than another.
—I’ll give the caveat that with the way LSU SVM’s website was set up when I was preparing to interview, my digging was not very fruitful

•Keep in mind that the interview isn’t just for them to shore up their interest in you but also for you to shore up your interest in that program: Is this a place you want to spend 4 grueling years of your life? Are the clinicians there people you want to work with and learn from?

•In general—at least I’ve been told that—they generally have a pretty good idea of who they want to admit before the interviews; so as long as you don’t say anything too outlandish, it probably won’t hurt your odds of being admitted|I am an LSU grad (c/o 2021) and would be happy to answer specific questions you might have about LSU in particular|Any in western NC?"

I applied with about 480 vet shadowing hours from one small animal clinic, about 20 hours working with a dairy farmer and some research experience involving mice.

PurpleSludgey737,"I'm a PM in the US. We head hunt 3rd and 4th year students who have excellent references from their professors. We then offer a contact to work for us for 5-10 years (depends on your production once employed) in exchange for paying for the 3rd and/or 4th year of school, along with a 10-20k relocation bonus of which students normally put 10-5k towards their school debt. There is a huge need here, and practices are willing to help you if you perform well in school, interview well, and pass the NAVLE. 

Learning the ins and outs of production and evaluating what a potential practice offers in terms of support, education, and estimate padding without financially castrating your client base should be a high priority for all new veterinary students. Also, never accept an offer from a practice that has negative production accrual, or you will fall even deeper into debt and be chained to the practice forever. A standard production percentage for new grads is 21-22%, paid out either monthly or quarterly. Many new grads put this towards their debt their first few years practicing. Make sure your first practice is run appropriately ie- will you receive production for rx's refilled, rx diets sold, etc? The answer should be yes.

Wish you the best! We need you out here :\]|Yes and the non compete part is huge! I've interviewed so many DVMs who are traveling 10, 15, sometimes 25 miles away from their home due to signing a contract with a non compete - and yes, many of them (but not all) are corporate. 

&#x200B;

OP - corporate practices and private practices have pros and cons;

Corporate Pros - huge capex bucket for repairs and maintenance and the newest technology, great rates with their primary labs that your PM can trickle down to your clients, pet funds for financially constrained pet parents, fully paid travel and sign up for CE events, a huge HR team accessible to all if you feel that something unjust is happening, a large network of hospitals to barrow LVTs or DVM from if you are short staffed, if you're having a bad quarter there is no threat of shutting the practice down because the corporate overlord will pay your bills until you are up on your feet again, etc.

Corporate Cons - red tape that hinders everything from the hiring process to changing your hospital's core values,  a lack of flexibility for DVM PTO usage, highly restrictive staffing ratios, strictly enforced overtime policies for your staff, pay range caps that cannot be challenged, etc. 

Private Pros - Your PM is truly in charge of your hospital from culture to hiring and more, normally having a direct line to the practice owner should serious concerns arise, supreme flexibility when it comes to schedule and PTO, in a good practice the money coming in is then distributed amongst the staff in the form of discretionary bonuses, you have the freedom to more easily terminate abusive clients, and in my experience you tend to have deeper ties to your local community, etc.

Private Cons - The practice normally lives and dies by the availability and patient capacity of the clinic & DVMs, a bad quarter or a DVM retiring will mean layoffs, if the hospital owner or PM are toxic then there is no HR to go to for solutions, 2nd or 3rd generation technology due to having normal opposed to deep pockets, most repairs are a PM or owner trying to fix the broken thing until it is officially ready for the garbage, if you get sued then you do not have the financial backing to fight something in court forever, etc.

&#x200B;

Most schools in the US are now offering financial and culture literacy classes, if you do go into vet med and these are available in your institution I would highly recommend you add them to your course load."

That being said, please be careful and take care of yourself self first. It’s not unheard of for schools to retaliate against students who speak out. And even if you don’t give your name, be careful about sharing details, etc because they have ways of narrowing down who it is, especially with such small class sizes.

Any sign of lack of confidence/weakness they strike. It’s part of why this field is so toxic and bad for mental health.

Would it be possible for you to respectfully stand up for yourself? For example, when the tech mentioned you might be good at Sx one day but for now you are not touching their animals, saying something like, “I understand your concern, but that comment was unnecessary. I did not offer or even suggest I do the Sx, so I would appreciate if you would keep your opinion of my abilities to yourself and allow the senior veterinarians to be the ones to assist me with my improvement.” Or when they made the ‘no offense but you’re not good with any sick animal’, responding “despite you saying no offense, that was offensive and I would appreciate it going foreword that you would reframe from such comments. You are not the one reviewing my performance or guiding me to being a better vet, so your negative comments are unwarranted and unnecessary.” (*honestly that might be more snippy than necessary, but you get my point.)

A lot of people are bitter in this field, make sure that it doesn’t dull your sparkle. We need the good kind vets who will support future baby vets and techs.|There is something to be said for confidence and reasonable caution. I also double check my work, I found others mistakes and my own frequently, and for certain things I have others check my work. I was told I was slow, but little to no errors were made. After a lot of criticism and jabs to my confidence, I tried to go faster. I made more mistakes and didn’t catch them until after the fact. All reversible, and avoidable if I would been allowed to double check myself or ask for assistance.

I find if you don’t meet the cocky confidence, making fun/hating on owners, hating/being aggressive with difficult patrons, life-sucks mentality; you are rejected, bullied, made to be miserable.

Sorry for ranting."

DouglasTwice,"I also failed the first time after doing 100% of vetprep. I was trying to learn instead of memorize. It’s a memorization exam. You’re wasting your time trying to become a better vet through the navle. 


I switched to Zuku and I found that to be a bit better. VetPrep does a better job of explaining things but I found VetPrep tends to hyperfixate on some topics (why are there 500 questions on listeriosis?). The Zuku question bank is more diverse, IMO. 

Get accommodation if you can. Anxiety, ADD, ect all have a chance of being eligible for time accommodation and there’s no penalty for being turned down.|The thing that surprised me the most about failing the navle for the first time is that absolutely nobody cares. It feels a bit embarrassing and your student cohort may gossip or whatever, but on a professional level nobody cares whatsoever. Everyone who has passed it has taken it, and most people who have taken it agree it’s pretty much valueless. 

In fact, if any vet professional or veterinary organisation thinks less of you for having resat the exam, that’s a huge red flag avoided.|I wonder if there is a 6 hour computer science exam the ICVA can take?|If I fail this exam again, I’m just gonna apply to work at the ICVA. No accountability, no oversight - sounds like a sweet gig.|Refuse to send scores over email for confidentiality concerns —> Spend thousands developing a web portal —> Have that web portal send out confidential scores to wrong people. Spectacularly bad.|They had no choice - they had a groupon that was about to expire|Can’t see them here|Some people saw them in the 10 mins they were available. Some people saw scores that were not their own. Some people can access the scores reported to the canadian association site. Most people haven’t seen them.|You’ll just email vetprep a copy of the official score pdf (when it is available)."

Sure, every place has some needy or crazy clients but they aren't all like that. There are a lot of skills you learn in your first year out. I think the skills in both communication and medicine will help a lot even if you do decide to do mobile practice -it isn't always as clear cut as that the owners have made their decision and want to PTS. I think that also would be extremely mentally taxing to do as a brand new grad. I am ER now and it is hard when I get >4/day....it affects you.

I would take the time to work in a clinic and develop your skills so you have a solid base-you have worked hard for years and practice is far different from school.

MN1314,"My issue is that I love vet med but I cannot get into vet school. I discovered my passion for vet med after graduating undergrad and I hate it for me. I love this profession so much that I worked as a vet assistant starting at $12.50 an hour full time while completing every pre-requisite I needed to apply. My grades weren’t stellar, but they were good enough to apply. I gathered SO many experiences the past four years, small GP and emergency, large, and exotic. My recommendations were great. But I was denied two cycles in a row. The applicants basically doubled from last year. File reviews tell me basically I’m “good but not good enough” and want me to get a masters degree that I don’t have five figures to dish out for right now. I’m 28 years old, I’ve gone into more debt for this profession, poured my heart and soul into this profession, moved up in my clinic to a lead surgery assistant, but I have absolutely nothing to show for it: no savings account, I’m single, barely able to afford rent, and all of my friends are advancing in their careers, starting families and own houses. I just have a pile of rejections. I’ve decided it may be time for me to move on from this profession that I love and use my bachelor’s degree that will make me 4x more money than I make now. It pains me to see vets go through bad experiences and leave the profession, I would give anything to be given a chance. I can’t imagine doing anything else with my life but I truly don’t think I can last another application cycle 😩
If you really love the profession, definitely go for it, but make sure you get lots of experiences at different clinics and different environments so you can truly get to know the profession and its people. It’s a thankless, hard job, but one of the most rewarding.|My issue is that I love vet med but I cannot get into vet school.

It's one of the things that is strongly convincing me of specializing if I do well enough in vet school since at least the number of residency spots isn't rapidly expanding.

I worry that this field will turn into what pharmacy looks like in the present day.|scrub allowance

gym membership

extra PTO

pension

but honestly making sure the health insurance is good. I am stuck at VEG for now but its not in my long term plan as long as they have shitty health coverage (covers only 80%)| *I tell you what, my love*, you have literally no fucking idea what you're talking about. You are not in any position to provide advice to someone when you haven't even stepped into this field yet.|I’m not saying you didn’t suggest it. In your case it was better to say nothing regardless. |I use Vetspire and it was definitely a UX upgrade compare to Cornerstone. Good software exists its just $$ that practices aren't willing to spend.

Switching software is a whole headache. not to mention you'll need to migrate records or support both softwares for several years.|Eh. Not necessarily especially with the advent of the M1 chip and above. The way they are able to integrate their hardware and software isn’t really possible for PCs. 

They hold their value much longer than PCs for a reason. My ten year old laptop is still fast enough to be my primary computer.|Idk. The comparable PC machines are at the same price point as mac or more expensive. I used to work in my college’s technology inventory and the only pro the Dell business grade laptops had was the repairability in-house|even without license protection - starting off as a tech is irresponsible. thats how we get posts like this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/VetTech/comments/17vene0/what\_are\_these\_and\_how\_often\_should\_they\_be/](https://www.reddit.com/r/VetTech/comments/17vene0/what_are_these_and_how_often_should_they_be/)

if you're new to the industry and they're actually making you do tech things (and not just a tech in name)-- thats a breeding group for malpractice.|with license protection thats not really a thing anymore. its irresponsible to recommend that someone without prior experience or schooling go straight into a technician role where they are expected to calculate drug dosage, monitor sedation, place ivc, monitor patients, etc|that sounds like a good plan. I also had a more skilled job (financial technology) and I was bored as hell and depressed. even if it doesn't require a lot of brain power to restrain an animal and clean--- there is a lot to learn and I found the process really enjoyable. I went the vet school route but imo nursing tasks are more ""fun"" its just that the pay isn't great.|iirc its self-reporting|There’s no point in working towards a specific career right now. Just do what you are interested in and get into a college that fits your needs|its not worth doing the VA program. just sign up for the VT. after getting a year or two of experience its a lot easier to get other VA jobs. just make it clear to your team and management that your invested in growing"

Ecstatic-Method-17,"I completely know how you feel. My whole life it has been animals and becoming a veterinarian but somewhere along the way I guess in high school I lost that confidence and gained more self doubt.

There will be struggles in our futures no matter what career we choose yes vet met comes with many but that passion and gut feeling we feel is there for a reason and we need to listen to it. When it comes down to it it’s not really just about the question of can I do it because honestly and truly we can all do anything we put our minds to. The question is how do you see your future when you are going through the ups and downs in life that are bound to happen. Do you see yourself coming home from work as a veterinarian even though it was a hard day you will be proud of the work or do you see yourself coming home from a job that may not completely fulfill you. Also looking at the bigger picture and diving deeper you need to see why you struggle with that confidence and self doubt just as I do. Somewhere along the way we started doubting ourselves and now we can either continue with those self limiting beliefs or we can prove to ourselves that we can do this. Try to build your confidence day by day by accomplishing the little things for me it’s been keeping active. I’ve been able to prove to myself that I can stick to a routine and it feels good which in turn has been giving me more confidence and allowing me to doubt myself less. You can do it I have complete faith in you and you should have faith in yourself too!! Work on your confidence and push out those self limiting beliefs. At the end of the day we are only on this earth for a short time so just go for it! I wish you all the best!!|I completely know how you feel. My whole life it has been animals and becoming a veterinarian but somewhere along the way I guess in high school I lost that confidence and gained more self doubt.

symphonyofflutes,"I've walked a few clients through the ingredients to explain that while they may sound impressive there's no evidence for them. And then I've pointed out that on their UK Website the three vets they use quotes from are not registered on the RCVS database (or the AVMA one as far as I can see). And then we discuss how their managing director and founders have no prior training in animal nutrition as listed by their own admission on their LinkedIn pages. 

Ultimately, if an owner isn't going to come into your consult room with an open mind and listen then you won't change their mind. I'm pretty sure studies have shown that owners who prefer alternative medicines (including herbal parasite treatments, raw homemade diets, no vaccines other than the primary course with no Lepto 4 cover) are inclined to be distrustful of whatever we say. So after you've done your due diligence in giving them the counter argument to all facebook forums then its up to them to make whatever decision they want to make. But at least you've made sure it's an informed one even if they choose not to listen."

thatfluffybabyduck,"The best way to know for sure is to be in it. Take up a job as an assistant at a clinic in your area. You'll see EVERYTHING. 

You can have emotions and feelings in this field. It's just a normal part of being a person. However, you have to be able to compartmentalize and not let those personal feelings get in the way of what is best for your patients. You have to be able to reel it in every now and then and realize that not everything is about you.

It's okay to cry and get angry. It happens. Just make sure you're expressing those feelings in an appropriate setting. If you have to take 5 or 10 minutes to collect yourself, that's okay. Don't let people give you shit for it. It's better that you come back to work with a level head."

But don't just take my word for it. If you are in the UK you are a member of the RCVS? Correct? They have a mentorship program. Reach out to your member, or if you do not have one, ask to be connected with one. See what they say.

There are also a list of day one, year one etc competencies. Or there used to be. Check that.

If it is too much for you you may need to look for another position, if your employer(s) are not listening to reason. I would not think finding a new position would be an issue.  Everywhere is hurting for vets.

Exactly part of my point. The reason to run a dVPN is to not rely on ISP's or centralized VPN provider's willingness to not screw us over our data, by monitoring or selling it.

Running a D-VPN node, decentralized VPN node, for this exact reason, why should we, and how could we then rely on a 'centralized' committee/deciding entity to validate what is Ok or not to run through our connections, and how could ""validation"" ever **prevent** 'validated parties' to miss-behave, and how said centralized validation body would ever care to or be able to plea for the node runner's innocence against the infractions committed by their validated partners.|Okay, great, multiple people, but still the case of one single country and jurisdiction, and still solely copyright issues.

As nothing but a tinkerer, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/) is a post I made a while back when I started running a node, and [some](https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/comment/hw2bwil/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) of the 'extra steps' I took and considered.

I would advocate Mysterium nodes (or any front-facing thing period) to never be ran natively, which I why I went ahead from the start with the ""unsupported"" configuration of running it on a sudoer user in its own dedicated unprivileged LXC container, and doing some fairly extended firewalling from the host (proxmox).

To be honest I would prefer Mysterium nodes to be distributed in this kind of form, as a turnkey LXC package for example. Little overhead, good perfs, and great for isolation/segregation. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/ta74bq/node_security_is_ridiculous/i05wele/ | Well, I defo did joined the cause, and discussed both the pros and the cons and some concerns with the community:

Either way, in the meantime, people like me will keep logging and metering their node for the reasons given in this post.

I admit I just had not noticed u/peter-sovietsquirrel was part of the team, I was just focused on answering every incoming observation and opinion the best I could.

I understand about your position, sadly I doubt it would suffice in France to be out of troubles.

If it can indeed let the node-runner deny responsibility of the activity he was taken to court for, it could still lead to fines and sanctions as running a somewhat critical service without proper -*and mandatory by law\*\*(see refs)*\- traceability, allowing bad actors to stay out of reach.

In the example in Germany, the guy was contacted by Right holders for copyright issues.

In France, you're directly facing Hadopi (now the [Arcom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_Authority_for_Audiovisual_and_Digital_Communication)). Their ""notices"" are warnings you can't rebut fully without going to court, and at the third in a given time period, your uplink is shut down and cops knock at your door.

Unless you're running a website with a mail address to be contacted on concerning copyright on the same IP, there is no ""amicable step"" of just talking the Right holders out beforehand.

&#x200B;

Keep in mind though I was **NOT** raising really concerns about relatively mundane stuff like torrenting or using an other country's netflix geo-locked catalogue (even if you can still end up with sanctions like fines);

But **WAY MORE** sensitive crimes, like cyber attacks or 'child media', for which French authorities, like the [ANSSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_nationale_de_la_s%C3%A9curit%C3%A9_des_syst%C3%A8mes_d%27information), would descend hard on you for being the roadblock in their investigation that made the actual criminals unreachable, and possibly charge you same as an accomplice.

&#x200B;

Concerning your no-log policy you want to abide by, **I hear you and won't push it further**, though I see it a bit as a marketing buzz-word in the VPN world which is only a matter of context.

I like transparency and control, hence why I'm much into the vision of web3.0, /hence why I would have wished node runners to have options to define AND transparently disclose their own policies about logging for every dVPN-client to see in their client interface.

All I can do now is hope that you or maybe an other network will consider it and implement it properly.

I'll still be hanging out in the community, and participating by running my node though with very custom filtering rules inside and outside the LXC container to avoid abuse.

**I take the pledge** to not stir up the topic of logging outside of [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/swx7dd/making_running_a_mysterium_node_legal_and_safe_in/) as to not disturb the community by starting useless debates, though I would be happy to discuss it again if the question is raised officially one day.

(as such, I also added an edit to the thread.)

\> what's worth a decentralized VPN if node runners would have to rely on a centralized authority to back their legal safety? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/swx7dd/making_running_a_mysterium_node_legal_and_safe_in/hxt3p23/ | Two things:

* That's one person in one country. Just saying ""twas not me, I run node"" without logs in hand is worth nothing to French authorities for example. The ""there was one guy who"" isn't really pertinent.
* Torrenting is kind of the least serious thing you could be concerned about legally. I think I already gave a few examples above that would prompt authorities of anywhere to not give a fuck about your argument of ""twas not me, I run node"" if you don't have means to prove it was someone else's doing. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/swx7dd/making_running_a_mysterium_node_legal_and_safe_in/hxtyyk2/ | \> NodeUI logs, however, aren't too detailed.

Yeah no, I confirm that to be protected, under french law, you have to have the above-mentioned details in your logs, or it's worth nothing as proof, just 'good enough' to assume you MAY be innocent, and it's up to whether or not the judge likes your face and had their coffee in the morning.

&#x200B;

\>The government is pretty strict about these things and can shut off your internet after about 3 infractions

Yup, even though they are ""kinda"" slow. Hadopi went through so many changes, and was such a wonky system that even if I 'technically' had a fair amount of reasons to receive notices from them (and did), I never receive 2 in a short enough period that the first was still valid and counting in the X/3 counter.

&#x200B;

\>I also can not assume that the Mysterium whitelisted traffic is benign.

Exactly part of my point. The reason to run a dVPN is to not rely on ISP's or centralized VPN provider's willingness to not screw us over our data, by monitoring or selling it.

Running a D-VPN node, decentralized VPN node, for this exact reason, why should we, and how could we then rely on a 'centralized' committee/deciding entity to validate what is Ok or not to run through our connections, and how could ""validation"" ever **prevent** 'validated parties' to miss-behave, and how said centralized validation body would ever care to or be able to plea for the node runner's innocence against the infractions committed by their validated partners. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/swx7dd/making_running_a_mysterium_node_legal_and_safe_in/hyj3w5y/ | Okay, great, multiple people, but still the case of one single country and jurisdiction, and still solely copyright issues.

And yes I know there is whitelisting, which basically excludes non-mysterium approved traffic, which basically excludes private users and randos all together, which basically defeats the reason I'm running a node at all, which is to give wider and less censored internet access to people, individuals, not just entities and organizations. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/swx7dd/making_running_a_mysterium_node_legal_and_safe_in/hxx2htr/ | Well, Chromebook means most likely you're still running ChromeOS... aka Gentoo Linux... which isn't really like 'standard' debian based linux for example.

Running a native node to which randos will connect to isn't really the best thing either if anything goes wrong.

I would say, for sake of simplicity, your best shot would be to first run an unprivileged LXC container, and install a small debian based image in it, make sure it can connect to the internet, AND gets its own IP on the local network (for sake of easy port-forwarding).

It would let you have a proper install that doesn't affect your host's configuration, and that you have absolute control over if needed.

Then follow the standard Linux CLI install.

When it comes to resources, my own full OS LXC container on proxmox, with the node running, and while the session is active, doesn't use more than 2.5gigs of storage space, and half of its assigned 128mb of ram. A bit storage heavy, but overall light to run.

If you wanna add a layer of security, possibly go into IPtables on your chromeOS/gentoo host and isolate it from the IPrange of your network, minus node's webui (port 4449), and minus gateway communications, but still blocking sensitive stuff like the gateway's webui and ports like 22/445/512.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Important note: If you already have a node running, having a second node on the same IP doesn't make any positive change, might even penalize you. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/svyahz/help_setting_node_up_on_chromebook/hxjjgmg/ | Thought little more tip:

You should give 3gigs of storage space total to the LXC container.

Using a lean debian 11 image, the node install script would fail with a 2gig virtual drive, because while unpacking you go over that amount.

&#x200B;

If you encounter issues, or want more details about how I went about with my setup, you can find a long read about it on a previous post of mine where I encountered some miss-configurations during installation (and some weird behavior that really wasn't how things should go), how I did some firewall configuration ect [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/), or see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/snwzzb/comment/hw8j91c/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) when with someone I went about firewall configuration for a docker install (which I haven't done myself, but wanted to know how I would go about doing it).

Keep in mind though, I'm not an expert, my word is as good as anyone else's, don't be afraid to do some of your own complementary research! ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/svyahz/help_setting_node_up_on_chromebook/hxky47g/ | Same, I think I had around 30 sessions from Benin, and my previous biggest client (\~24h/450GB) was from a Japanese IP. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/suacdz/a_new_big_client_who_decided_to_download_the/hxahqi5/ | It seems they like to ping for uptime/latency, or that Netherland has a bigger community of dVPN clients. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/suacdz/a_new_big_client_who_decided_to_download_the/hxaho3y/ | for just 2 weeks of running this node, if it keeps going at this rate every week a big client like that, I will fucking offset the powerdraw of my whole rack just with mysterium. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/suacdz/a_new_big_client_who_decided_to_download_the/hx9htfa/ | French residential IP, I don't mind answering, I have enough old comments in french speaking of stuff happening in France that I'm already country-doxed. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/suacdz/a_new_big_client_who_decided_to_download_the/hxaexc4/ | https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/suacdz/comment/hxaexc4/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3 ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/suacdz/a_new_big_client_who_decided_to_download_the/hxd6my2/ | Hey hi, I followed your issue on their repo. Their actually-intended default configuration looks to be fine. Not the best, but clearly mindful.

I would guess what caused this behavior on my setup is somehow wireguard or myst didn't configured itself properly, or had issues interacting, fluke knows why, in my LXC container, even though the only modifications done to have the mysterium install script work was to spoof it to generic linux headers, fill in missing packets and add some gpg repo keys manually.

Something, between this or a quirk in the default debian11--container-image provided by proxmox might have borked something.

I solved the issue on my end, but I'll keep the firewall good-behavior cage around the container just for peace of mind and added layer of security.

So it might be specific to this kind of installation, but **if it can bork like** ***that*** **and this easily**, adding a way to review and modify the wireguard and firewall config (what parameters are to be applied to ephemeral wireguard interfaces) directly from the webui would allow plug&play-expecting beginners/neophytes to be warned about, troubleshoot and fix such issues, especially since not everyone would go from a clean install or strictly supported and tested distro/config.

Maybe a mindful feature to implement in the near future?

&#x200B;

Thank you u/Steccas for taking the time out of your day to file an issue and do the follow up on it. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/hvon472/ | Excuuuuse me chucklenut, even that's lot of word for ""TLDR+RTFM"", jimmies rustled it seems.

I expressly follow the native linux install guide, aka the **fucking manual**. I haven't touched how Mysterium configures wireguard by default.

(and I don't want to because I want that node to be 'set&forget', I don't want to do maintenance when whatever I would have done would have it break later if the myst-devs change something)

Had to just tweak the linux headers install process and patch in the missing packets (using snapshots to launch the install, get errored out, snapshot rollback, pre-install packets, not get errored out at the same step, rinse and repeat)

I'm just here venting the fact that the default install (aka, by the book) looks to have a concerning oversight in its configuration. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/hveo6p9/ | *\[ -using docker can let someone achieve even host isolation \]*

Such as LXC unpriviledged container too in my case. I commend mysterium's guide to at least advise beginners to create a sudoer user instead of running the node as root, but I was more worried about beginners/neophytes who would run their node bare-metal, like on a raspPi, or on an old spare laptop/computer... possibly with a slew of vulnerabilities, or worse even, with other services running on that same box that could badly interact and/or be exploited, **plus** the fact that in this case you can't firewall it *from outside* like a container without a proper firewall box plugged to it, where user-friendly market end users are more-often-than-not using their ISP's holly router as sole 'smart' network equipment. 

*\[Also, I think that better work to prevent bad traffic FROM the node can be taken.\]*

Yes indeed, for the proxmox firewall-ing of the container, I denied it all interaction (egress and ingress) with the full IP range used by hosts on the network(minus gateway), along with sensitive gateway ports like its webui for example, or ports that would allow to gather information on the maker/software of the gateway.

Exception made of needed things such as the node's webui, still reachable by a few select hosts.

Technically, the node's container could even be rooted that who ever is in it still couldn't touch the Lan.

Imo, and that's a very personal view on it, given **the stakes of running a wide open vpn node to a residential network**, Mysterium nodes should be advised to be used **only** in containerized form (docker/lxc/lxd) since they're aiming at and talking to a mainly beginner audience.  
\+ Docker or LXD(using snap) should let it run just fine on a raspPi, and without some of the risks.  
Distributing it as a ready-to-run container would also avoid any chance of fluke-miss-configuration upon installation.

\--------------

Concerning your contribution plans, DNS filtering yes yes, would be very welcomed, and god yes monitoring. Saw in the issue thread you were thinking of graphana integration as a possibility, that would be great!

Whenever you create your repo and push something you consider satisfactory or need people to beta-test, don't hesitate to ping me if you want me to add it to an edit at the top of the post for everyone to benefit from it. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/hvoyhzr/ | As you say, I know you're supposed to, at least for peace of mind.

But instead of just brut-blocking shit like a creature of habit keyboard facepalmer, I wanted to know what Mysterium's out-of-the-box experience was, and its behavior on an *almost typical residential network*. Observe the enemy.

Since this Dapp advertises itself as an user-friendly/**beginner-friendly** secure VPN, I took on myself to actually test its claims by following the install guide and **not** doing any extra *smart stuff* about it (aside from Proxmox-LXC image specific patching ups)

I allowed myself to see how Mysterium behaves out of the box in a controlled environment with solely already fairly hardened hosts on the network, all the hosts on that network have restrictive firewalls, SSL certificates with my own local CA, SSH keys, ect, and critical shit like IPMI interfaces or proxmox's datacenter access is segregated to an other network all together.

But the network I tested this on is managed by a residential off-the-shelf-from-my-ISP router with fairly standard config and features to the average consumer's.

And I came back to report on what I saw? To give a heads up to 'neophyte/beginner' node runners who may just have followed a tutorial to install it on a spare laptop or RaspPI they had lying around?

That maaaay be why my post is flaired as an alert, not a question. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/hveszrn/ | Mhm.

Basically if it was something that you know you have to do SOME config to selfhost, like a nginx+certbot reverseproxy&certification setup, it's assumed that you're gonna have to trust in the tutorial of whoever blogposter or content creator you learn from, and you know from the start that it will be a little journey and have to have security in mind.

But Mysterium presents itself as a set&forget for both node and client, and competing in the same space as centralized VPNs... not exactly the same ""targets"" obviously, the more curious-tinkerer ones, but ultimately its communication is leveled to speak to end users.

And I mean 'end-users', little to no skill/knowledge requirement announced.

And thus, the Node runner guide is roughly the same length as the DVPN user guide, in appearance thus ""as simple and straightforward"".

That's how it's 'marketed', by the Mysterium team as well as every content creator I saw talking about it.

Encouraging whoever will give them an ear to set up a node on a raspberrypi by just flashing and heading straight to the webui, no further configuration, or else to do it on a spare computer, spin up a fresh install of ubuntu or debian, install myst, jump to webui, no further configuration.

The section in which the guide actually talks about firewall and NAT is solely about troubleshooting an offline node... aka, tell you to punch holes, but not really anything about plugging up holes.

&#x200B;

I wouldn't say ""Mysterium bad"", because it's indeed the node runner's responsibility to secure their network, and to not install shit on it they can't control.

But share fault, because you wouldn't advertise a sport car as a ""beginner friendly"" car to a new driver on probation license, and *omit* to tell them it's delivered with ABS toggled off. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/hvh8m4r/ | *\[How did you block the webui? A rule using the container ip/subnet itself? What about the container localhost?\]*  
*\[Wich rules did you use? You have some suggestions?\]*  


Concerning the webui specifically, I actually limited from the outside-container firewall's ingress to the 4449 container port with as sources specific network IPs, dropping every other source.  
I will admit I took no action to protect the node's webui from dVPNclients connecting to the node (which shouldn't be needed if the node's config is applied properly), but I'm not too worried about it:

* webui's password is 50+ characters long, and not reused anywhere else, as well is the root password of the unpriviledged LXC container, and as well is the sudoer user password.
* I'm not running a decentralized VPN node for profit, but by conviction. Nothing they could do in the webui could damage my network, worse case scenario they steal my MYSTT, which I don't care about.

&#x200B;

When it comes to the other firewall's rules, I did my firewalling specific to my setup, and I re-iterate, I'm not a security expert or an expert anything, my *suggestions* I would be more curious to see how much you'll roast my firewalling more than anything!

Second, keep in mind I did all that as a container's firewall, configured from the host, which is applied to the virtual NIC from the host perspective.  
Leaving the source IP blank on firewall egress on that NIC means it catches all potential IPs the node may use.

\-**Egress** \- default Output policy : **Accept**.

Let's start: first a few destination ports this node should never have to contact, who ever is using that through a VPN is clearly trying to poke around, **Reject** on all:

* 514 in udp (remote syslog)
* 445 in tcp (active directory and samba shares, previously also netbios on old windows versions)
* 135 tcp&udp (MS RPC)
* 137-139 tcp&udp (Netbios IP legacy)
* 161-162 udp (SNMP)
* I technically should (you should) block IRC ports (6660-6669 tcp) because a lot of botnet use them, but since I run my node per conviction of help to stop speech/info censorship, I want IRC chats to be reachable through it.

Then **Reject** egress by macro HTTPS and HTTP destined to the precise IPs (CIDR32) of all my subnet's gateways, to protect their web interfaces.

Then **Reject** all egress to an IPset that represents all the static IPs of all server hosts on the on all the subnets (by CIDR32)(multiple proxmox nodes, an unraid NAS) (redundant with the rule bellow, but eh, peace of mind for a moron)

Then an IPset that take each of my subnets IP ranges (CIDR24), minus the ones of the gateways (CIDR24), and **Reject** all egress to them.

\----------------  
Then we need to talk a bit of why my network is structured like shit:  
I'm on fiber (2Gbps down, 600mbps up)  
My ISP (which is the most stable in my location, hence why I'm with them) doesn't deliver a modem and a router. The router has an onboard integrated modem.  
Not an SFP+ slot, not a coax, not anything, I legit have single mode fiber cable between a wallplate and my internet box.  
If I wanted to use my own equipment, I would be a proprietary firmware ONT SFP+ hacking journey that, even successful, could fail any day without notice whenever my ISP change something on their side.  
Also, that shitty box doesn't support ANYTHING. No link aggregation/DACP/trunk, not multiple subnets, not ip ranges superior to /24, not VLANs, and ONLY has 4 1gbps ports.  
So I just threw together a small OPNsense box that manages 4 subnets (including the IPMI management one and the one dedicated to hosts administration like the ssh and webuis of proxmox and unraid), but the 'main' subnet is directly onto the ISP router... because my OPNsense box is a very low power salvage, and would struggle too much with the kind of throughput I have.

Hence why the last egress rules are very specific to my setup and dedicated to ""patch"" issues with that shitty router/gateway I'm stuck with, and not really relevant to list here, but if you're curious, here's a nice [example](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2018-20377/) from one of the previous models from my ISP, hence my lack of trust.  
By default you can think about putting a **Reject** on all egress that would have gateways as destination on ports like 21 22 and 23 for example.  
Still, it's 'setup specific'! (I don't feel comfy sharing these to be honest, to not expose if I overlooked something important that could then be exploited!)  
\-------------

If I didn't had a brain-derp, it should allow the node wide access to the world wide web on most ports, minus ones that are in the non-sense category, while excluding all my subnets' hosts from being reachable, still worse case scenario allows to 'sense' my gateways but not know what maker/type they are.

&#x200B;

**Ingress** \- default Input policy: **Drop**

Then using an Alias that represent the ONLY allowed IP of the node on my network (thus excluding potential 'spawns' which would then default to drop all ingress), I defined these rules to that Alias:

**Accept** ingress on 4449 (webui) and 22 (SSH) from an IPset of specific (CIDR32) local ips

**Drop** a little list of outright all sources ingress, for peace of mind: 20,21,22,23,67,68,69,79,98,110,111,113,119, all sources. I'm almost sure I did a mistake in there, but so far people connecting to the node don't seem to have been to distraught about it, since I had clients with hour long sessions.

**Reject** on all port the IPset of all my subnets' on /24CIDRs minus the gateways (cleaner than drop for local network, that same rule is the default on all my hosts and their containers/VM, to reduce propagation risks from a compromised host to an other)

**Reject** a macro HTTPS/HTTP/LDAP ingress, because I don't want people to use it as a webhost (I'm selfhosting some stuff myself, that doesn't seem to be a good idea), denying LDAP is to avoid being used as a proxy for log4j exploits that use LDAP, but there is probably a lot more I could/should block

**Accept** on the ranges 10000:25560,25570:60000, to let clients connect to the node through the widest range of ports it uses and listens to.   
Only left a little space in the middle because I have friend's MC servers running.

That's about it, minus a few rules to no-log some stuff like the ISP router doing some multicast to 224.0.0.0/24,its-subnet/24, and pinging the shit out of everything.

To anyone reading, it's not advice, and I probably made a terrible mistake somewhere, don't copy, ask for an actual security expert, which I'm not.

&#x200B;

*\[In my case, I'm not going to run nodes in a home network/home lab environment, I'm not comfortable with that.\]*

Understandable!

*\[I'm running them hosting/vps etc.\]*

I considered it. Though often hosting/vps IPs are blocked by a lot of services (including streaming plateforms), but also are very susceptible to being blocked and/or monitored by countries/organizations which intend to censor and do speech/opposition repression, which kinda would defeat the point of why I run a node!

*\[I'm planning to use SWAG\]*

I already use SWAG to frontface some stuff to a cloudflare proxy, but I plan on switching to traefik for that too, which I already use internally for SSL for stuff that isn't publicly 'presented'.  
You could add a layer of auth (+ with 2fauth on top) using Authelia eventually.


[1/2] ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/hw2bwil/ | [2/2]

*\[For this in planning to: \[...\]\]*

That's indeed a whole stack! What could be a solution would be to produce a shell script that, in a standard LXC (or even baremetal) bog standard debian, would pull all the mysterium pihole suricata etc needed sources and automatize most of the config, only asking to input the parameters needed (like the static IP, subnetIPrange/CIDR, and gateway(s) to use for the stack on the actual local network) in order to make it as secure as it should be and as beginner friendly as it advertises itself to be.

As you saw, my setup is waaaaaay simpler than that, probably also way less informed, but in a situation were I don't care about the node's 'internal' security that much, more about it not touching anything in my turf and not being used 'too' maliciously.

&#x200B;

*\[In any case I thank you for the insights, the suggestions you're giving and for volunteering to help with the repo.\]*

My *'insights'* are more just remarks/conceptions of someone who has widespread but sparse understanding/knowledge, with a lot of holes.  
I saw stuff that seemed (almost instinctively) problematic, and while I can conceptualize solutions, building a whole stack (let alone automating it) that would both be completely securely tight AND plug&play is kinda beyond my skills.   
I see myself further in the category of code tinkerer than actual coder, more a security enthusiast and not at all an expert.

I will indeed check out the repo, probably try it myself, report on it, eventually point out issues if I see some, but I probably won't have a complete solution to anything!

Though as I said, as soon as you're comfortable enough with your repo, I'll link it at the top of the post in an edit, so more eyes are on it, and probably some from people who are more knowledgeable and crafty than myself!  


  
*\[Looking forward to read your opinions.\]*

Yup, well, indeed it was more opinions than solutions or even insights from my part.

Looking forward to see you roast my firewall rules ;) ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/hw2bzaz/ | *\[To be honest you did a great job, I'd just add blocking of malformed IP packets and rate limits for SYN and ICMP packets.\]*

Showing how much I'm not an expert, I actually never tried to do that with Proxmox's firewall, I'll have to try that!

*\[Regarding traefik, I think it is way better to stand with nginx, and especially swag that has fail2ban integrated.\]*

Fair! I just found traefik a bit easier to play with, but that's entierely personal. It's more flexible when it comes to adding removing services on the fly, doesn't need reloads or rebuilds. Hence my choice for internal SSL!

I think it's just that failtoban looses a bit of its importance when I'm hiding with cloudflare's proxy, caching and filtering.  


*\[On the VPS vs ISP: I honestly think that they are still monitored in any case.\]*

Yeah ISPs are monitored like VPS are, but residential addresses are not as blocked as datacenter IPs from a country to an other, or by platforms that geoblock.

My node is thus still available to a wider audience, with access to a wider array of services than if it was running on a VPS I think.

Also I'm kinda serving my own ends by running a node, because my internet usage from my ISP's point of view becomes an indecipherable mess of a wide array of profiles and languages mixed together, basically stopping them from building a profile.

In that way, 'being a VPN' can protect your identity almost as much as using one.

&#x200B;

*\[wich DNS will be used by the VPN client\]*

I'm puzzled about it too.

But I would assume they are using the DNS they are configured with on their machine, since I haven't seen (or else missed it) custom DNS options in the VPN's code ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/hwehrap/ | 1. no. I'm running mine in an LXC debian container with as available resources 10% of a single core of a 9th gen processor, and 128mb of ram. A session just finished at this moment after 23h58 with \~445GB transfered, and the node didn't even touched half its resources. It's not resource intensive at all.
2. yes. you will be better placed to have clients who will send/receive lots of data. 1GB earns you almost as much as 200hours of session. Ping can also matter to some clients.
3. Not on the same IP, I doubt it.

The node is indeed residential, but in a virtualized environment, with a firewall applying to it from outside its container.  
If you're curious about security, I had a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/) where I had a configuration issue outside the box and quite a bit of discussion in the comments.

And since I'm not on whitelist, be conscious I may be taking a bit of a risk.

&#x200B;

Other than that, we are at 275GB on this session at the moment I'm writing, the container still doesn't use more resources, still at 62MiB of used memory. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/snwzzb/well_someones_having_a_downloading_spree_i_see/hw7pqfi/ | I can't give you a straight answer, the previous ""long session"" I had was a 19hours long from Japan who transferred \~750mB, and I had a dozen of ""short sessions"" who did about 100 to 500mB.  
Key points:

\- I'm on a 2Gbps down 600mbps up connection

\- I have low ping

\- My node's self-test indicates it is 'Full cone', so I am as reachable as possible (while with docker container I could only achieve Symmetric Nat restricted cone, surely due to how my network and hosts are structured)

\- Clearly allocated resources don't matter. Allocated 10% of a single core of a 9th gen processor and 128mb of ram of RAM to the debian LXC container, the average use of these both was under half the total allocation for the whole 23h58 session, and the few CPU spikes weren't above 80-90%... so 8-9% of a 9th 35WTDP cpu.

&#x200B;

So I don't know how I attracted them, but I guess what made them stay was stability, throughput and ping? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/snwzzb/well_someones_having_a_downloading_spree_i_see/hweiqdt/ | Well, running myst bare metal is indeed more risky than running it in a container if anything goes wrong or miss-configured.

I will give you under what 'advices' I can, keep in mind I'm not a security expert, just a tinkerer, and I'm not above making mistakes when giving advices either, it's to give you a 'guideline' idea!

Taking a raspberry Pi as an example, given how little resources the node uses, it's a bit of a waste of a Pi to just run the node on it.

So the idea would be to have the Mysterium node running in docker and segregated from your other docker containers that you then could run on your PI, and also segregated from your network.

* Without going too deep into it, here's what my recommendations would be for a rasp-pi node:
* install bog-standard raspbian
* install docker
* go for a docker container installation of myst instead of bare metal.

It being in docker means you can also more easily set up firewall rules for the container outside of the container, which means that if anything goes wrong **within** the Mysterium container, in all logic it shouldn't be able to bypass your firewall rules or touch your host so long it's an unprivileged container.

The bare minimum rules to protect your network would be the following, assuming your IP range is 192.168.0.0/24 (aka 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.0.255, and your gateway(router) is 192.168.0.1):

Create a network bridge in docker that will let the container have its own IP:

    $docker network create -d macvlan --subnet 192.168.0.0/24 --ip-range 192.168.0.128/31 --gateway 192.168.0.1 -o parent=eth0 br0docker

(I leave it the possibility to take ip 192.168.0.128 or 192.168.0.129 to avoid possible conflicts, but you can reduce it to one with /32, or expend the range)

&#x200B;

Create an IPset that represents your local network, minus your gateway:

    $ipset create lan-gw hash:net comment
    $ipset add lan-gw 192.168.0.0/24 comment ""lan IP range""
    $ipset add lan-gw 192.168.0.1/32 nomatch comment ""gateway""

And one that represent the IPs your node may have:

    $ipset create mystip hash:net comment
    $ipset add mystip 192.168.0.128/31 comment ""mystip""

And one of the IPs on your lan that you want to allow accessing the node's webui:

    $ipset create mystwebui hash:net
    $ipset add mystwebui 192.168.0.24/32

In the example above, only the computer on your lan using the  192.168.1.24 will be able to reach the node's webui. You can add more if needed.

The following firewall rules would be a ""minimal"" security setup imo, to protect your other devices on the network and your router from the node, while still allowing it full connectivity over the dVPN ports, and a select webui access from your chosen device:

    $iptables -I INPUT -m set --match-set mystip dst -m set --match-set lan-gw src -p tcp --dport 4449 -j ACCEPT
    $iptables -A INPUT -m set --match-set mystip dst -m set --match-set lan-gw src -j REJECT
    $iptables -A INPUT -m set --match-set mystip dst -p udp --match multiport --dports 10000:25560,25570:60000 -j ACCEPT
    $iptables -I OUTPUT -m set --match-set mystip src -m set --match-set lan-gw dst -j DROP
    $iptables -I OUTPUT -m set --match-set mystip src -d 192.168.0.1 -p tcp --match multiport --dports 22,80,443 -j DROP 
    $iptables --policy INPUT DROP
    $/sbin/iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4

(I know -i ethX and other stuff could be used, but just trying to keep it setup-agnostic and simple, all setup change modifications would only require changes in IPset)

I advise you to read a bit about iptables and how docker can modify them, it's a headache but a necessary one.

Make sure your node always starts in docker with the following extra parameter so it gets its own IP, seperate from your Pi host, on your network for ease of portforwarding:

    $docker run --network br0docker .....

As for CLI into the container, use the docker CLI for that from your raspberryPI.

&#x200B;

I haven't done it myself so I can't tell you it's all good to go, but that would be my take on it in my head if I went to do it, if it can be of any help as a starting point.

(I run an LXC container on Proxmox instead, and even then my setup isn't perfect I'm sure). ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/snwzzb/well_someones_having_a_downloading_spree_i_see/hw8j91c/ | I repeat: I'm not a security expert nor anything, just a tinkerer. I might be wrong about some stuff, I may have made mistakes I'm not seeing.

Really the reason I made this answer it's less about giving you instructions to follow, more like giving you the idea/understanding of what we're trying to achieve to secure it, and the steps I imagine I would have to take to make it happen, using only tools that are well documented and recognized.

Again, I don't have a RaspPi atm, I haven't tried it on docker either.

I went for an LXC container so I could test the bare-metal native install in a containerized environment to have more control over it, reduce risks and monitor it, which achieves in essence the same concept of container+outer firewall.

Really the better advice if any that I can give you is to look and ask around, either here or on linux dedicated reddits about IPtables/IPset and Docker, and be curious to dive in documentation/tutorials made by people more knowledgeable and skilled than I am! ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/snwzzb/well_someones_having_a_downloading_spree_i_see/hw8xmrz/ | Well, two things:

1. you must have created the IPsets corresponding first. Ipset is a 'companion package' to iptables, be sure it's installed!
2. it's `--match-set` , two times  `-` , not `—match-set` ;)
3. wait, I fucked up some synthax, gimme a moment to edit -- edited, might not be above still having left an error in, but I just had a brain-blank about how to declare source and destination properly with match-sets. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/snwzzb/well_someones_having_a_downloading_spree_i_see/hw98pkx/"

corinne1219,"Yes to brooks & hokas!!!! Majority of my coworkers have brooks and & hokas (i LOVE my hokas) they’re so comfy, not narrow too on the toes, and pretty slip proof. You cant go wrong with a cute pair of comfortable shoes :)|this exactly! I started as a kennel, with a good practice, & supportive HR & managers/supervisors, if you state your goals and aspirations, most places will want to help you achieve that. From my experience, practices prefer to train ‘in house’ than hiring someone new and training them from square one for VA. keep an open mind, everything happens for a reason so don’t beat yourself up if they don’t train you as quick as you desire . but planting the seed & informing your superiors is a great start! Good luck & i hope everything works out :)|Hi!!! When i was interviewed as kennel , it was less about the job experience you have, more on how you handle certain situations. questions such as “how have you handled a conflict in the workplace” “how comfortable are you working with difficult animals” “what would you do in a situation like…”, and “how comfortable are you with euthanasia”. During your interview include your aspirations to become a vet, and how grateful you are to have the opportunity to meet with your interviewers since this a great step to work towards your future career. be confident with everything you say. ask questions! “is the schedule fixed or does it rotate?” “is their room for growth? Id love to learn CSR (customer service rep) / VA (veterinarian assistant)…” etc . Good luck OP!! i hope everything works out :)|oh my gosh, i forgot today was friday. I hope your interview went well :)"
Jazzyhoss,"Are you worried because you’re an Island student coming into Purdue? Most of my island friends did great and had a decent experience. There was some prejudice against island students from staff (more technicians than anyone) but the admin during my year have Island students the same name badges as us Purdue students so it was harder to determine. 

Most rotations are very work-like hours. Internal medicine, surgery, and emergency/critical care rotations have the longest hours, sometimes with night treatments. Learning about other schools now, I’d say Purdue often uses its fourth year vet students as cheap tech labor. On one hand you do get some decent training and exposure to more cases. On the other hand doing eye drops in ECC at 11pm isn’t really what you as a vet will be doing post graduation. So look at the treatment plans of your patients and try and understand the whys. A lot too depends on how helpful your blockmates are and teamwork. My blockmates were always great about pitching in to get things done. 

I really enjoyed my Ancillary rotation. The hours were great and the workload wasn’t over the top and we saw a lot of sad, but interesting cases. My poultry rotation was probably my favorite, but I dont really see chickens anymore. But Dr. Wakenell, the poultry princess was a riot and amazing to work with. I believe she retired a few years ago.|My friends just reminded me that internal medicine in particular we only got one day off. I vaguely remember going home and writing more SOAPs at home. And that’s small and large animal. Small animal ECC we had maybe 3 or 4 scheduled days off. Usually between day shift and night shift. But I remember being called into school for a rounds meeting. Anesthesia and surgery had weekend off, but I believe there was an on-call schedule."

ClearWaves,"Anatomy of great apes and humans is very similar. There  simply isn't a veterinarian with as much experience as this MD. Other specialty surgeries, like ortho or dentistry, are also performed by MDs or dentists.  The animals in question are too valuable to not have the best person available to perform the procedure. Would a human doctor be called to perform a c-section on a lion? No. The lion's anatomy is closer to a cat than a human, so a veterinarian is more suited for the job. 

As far as legality goes... every state has different laws, and different types of animals are governed by different laws. As in domestic pets, livestock, poultry, wildlife, laboraty animals, etc.

Research facilities follow different rules than a small animal general practice. As a zoo is likely accredited as a research institution. That means having to follow certain rules but also makes allowances for treatments that don't apply to a privately owned dog or cat.

In short: in this case, an MD is the best person for the job, and the laws of each state's veterinary medical board have set rules for different areas of verterinary medicine.|This comment!|Anatomy of great apes and humans is very similar.

That-Science7707,"Anyone else suffering WAY too much right now? The waiting game is absolutely horrible. I just feel so alone because I don't know anyone else taking the exam since I am a foreign vet and it's just been too much :( all I have is reddit
I have no idea if my scores really were correct, and I told my entire family I had passed... having a hard time coping. I know stressing about it won't make a difference, but I can't help it|Now they have taken my score down from the NEB CVMA portal... anyone else from Canada with the same issue?|I still have the no documents available message!|Canadians/international students: scores available through the NEB portal.|Yeah, I'm terrified honestly. Counting every minute and stressed out of my mind.|Did you just get this email? Or was it earlier in the day before all hell broke loose?|My NEB scores still aren't up :(|Well, what makes me calmer is that on the NEB website the date that I sat the exam was right next to the score.

Since the problem was with ICVA releasing switched up reports, I am just guessing they sent out the wrong PDFs to each candidate on the ICVA portal, but the computed score results that get sent to the NEB must be from a simple database, since no score report is given on NEB.

This is all that soothes my head at the moment and in no way am I certain about this. Just so that I can sleep.

BTW: I had already told the whole family that I passed, and now am embarrassed to tell them that there is a possibility, however small, that I didn't.|Going through the NEB process through CVMA. Still no scores.|I sincerely hope you pass and get a great job right away! The FASS papers gave me a good laugh though haha|Thank you so much! I hope you pass and never have to worry about this again|You gave me some hope, god bless|They sure are taking their sweet ass time, so I am assuming they screwed up big time aswell. I am starting to doubt that they will fix it by today.|I have seen that they constantly email some people and not others, or there is a massive delay between each candidate receiving said emails. But yeah, they sent it and assured that by 5pm it would be fixed and they would email us. Not so sure I trust them now.|But in my case, the date was correct, so I am assuming that my score was real... I think...|Can they still login and see it or did they just see it that one time shortly after it was released?|I believe it is, since it got my test date correct.|Hopefully it means that they are close to sorting out the issue... if the results do come in, let us know!

and I hope you pass :)"

slambiosis,"I have worked in practices that have Idexx, Heska and Zoetis. My current hospital has Zoetis. I definitely prefer Idexx for a few reasons:

 I'm in Canada and Zoetis doesn't have a local rep that can drop in and help with our machines. Every time I had an issue with Idexx, I'd immediately get an email from our rep offering to come in and assist us. Also, the Idexx staff were friendlier than Zoetis staff.

I am unfamiliar with what additional services Zoetis offers. I already know I can get every test I've already looked up from Idexx. I had started doing SDMA in-house in my senior cat years ago and now we have to send it away. I like how Idexx allows you to build your own panels.

I find Vet Connect easier to use than Zoetis Fuse. I'm not sure if you can access your test results outside of the computers that have Fuse bookmarked on it - but you can with Vet Connect.

I am beginning to wonder if our lack of having a local rep may be why we don't know how to use Zoetis efficiently 😆

The Idexx store has a TON of free items that you can order whenever you want - from culture tubes to free blood tubes to shipping materials. It would always arrive within 48 hours of the order being placed.

The HM5 rotors don't require you to spin the blood before you put them in it, which is nice. The boxes take up more room in the fridge compared to Idexx. The first Zoetis clinic I worked at didn't have the pipette for the blood and I messed up a few rotors by introducing too little blood or air bubbles into the sample - word of advice, don't lose that pipette.

The only downside to Idexx is how they're always trying to upsell you a product or service - because of that, some veterinarians don't trust some of their products and services. In my Idexx practices, everyone loved the Quant C6 and SDMA - the folks in my Zoetis practices feel there isn't enough research behind them and they're ultimately just a money-maker for Idexx."

Zuralai,"I always hear this and, while I think it's very valid advice...it always makes me a little sad. ER is my passion, and I'm a 2nd year in vet school - was an ER tech for 5 years beforehand (and while working during breaks.) 

Do you say this because when you graduate you're still a wet-behind-the-ears baby vet and you don't have much experience?|Thank you so much for your reply, I appreciate it so much. Ad a tech I have worked with a veterinarian that definitely was in over her head and was ultimately let go and that is my greatest fear. 

In your opinion, is it acceptable to start right away in ER if you have good mentorship, or is it to be avoided entirely?"

And even tho we are two separate companies, my store and banfield have always worked close together, so we all already look at each other as coworkers.

I would like to thank you for setting up this AMA. My congratulations to you and the team, you all have been working very hard over the past years. The application is great and I’m excited for what the future will bring. Keep it up!

I do have some questions, hope you don't mind me asking.  
 

**Team:**  


* Can you tell us something about the team? How many people are currently working at Mysterium?  
 

**Community:**  


* Do you think the community members and backers of Mysterium are important and why?
* How do you think Mysterium can improve to get the community more involved? 

  
**Networking:**  
Mysterium was on the foreground raising awareness in the Ethereum community by building this important piece of tech, a decentralized VPN network. After the fundraising Mysterium went mysteriously quiet. Nowadays, barely anyone from the Ethereum community or the Web3foundation knows about you guys. Which is sad because many of them are located in Berlin where Mysterium is based as well.

I remember Robert visited Devcon a few years ago in Cancun. The other Devcons, ETHBerlin, DAPPcon…. You guys were just not there.  
 

* Is there any particular reason why Mysterium stays absent at major, important events?
* And do you think it should be improved and how?
* Do you think networking is important?

**Tokenomics:**

As far as I know, the decision making about what role MYST tokens have inside Mysterium mainly took place internally in the team. The community was never involved.   


* What different token models did you explore or study?
* How do you think the current model will create value for MYST?
* Will MYST tokens have a governance role in the future?
* Did you explore any staking contract models?   
For example, where every MYST token transaction pays a tiny amount of fee to a staking contract. The one who stakes more is collecting more fees.
* Will Mysterium create a MYST liquidity pool on Uniswap in the future? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/gc3zxw/ama_jaro_šatkevic_head_of_product_9_am_est_5th/fpjlt4h/"

I glanced at some of the comments, and it seems like you are more passionate about the rescue side? Is that right? I wanted to say that rescue and vetmed are very different and do not give you the same feelings. For example, it feels rewarding saving a homeless, starving cat off a street compared to treating a patient that is someone’s pet. I do acknowledge that both are still saving lives tho|I have a main career where I’m a data scientist (statistics and computer science) and being a vet assistant is just an extension from doing animal rescue because I do enjoy the work, just not 4x per week for the pay that I get lol

Ohimesama781,"I remember a colleague of mine sharing a story abt a dog patient she had that had open-type pyometra. Owners were given the treatment options available (surgery or conservative tx with antibiotics); she also highly recommended that surgery be done. Owners declined surgery, decided to do an antibiotic course instead. Medications were prescribed, clients were educated on how to give said medications and other things to note abt their pet's condition (and to bring in their pet immediately if the symptoms seem to be worsening even with the medications). They were also advised to come back for a follow-up after a week if the pet's condition seems to be improving with the prescribed medications.

A week after the first visit, the dog is brought in in a worse state than their previous visit, owners are frustrated because their dog is worse than before. Colleague asks if they've given the medications as prescribed. The owners' response? No, they haven't given the medication *at all*. 🙃"

etherunit07,"Hello,

Thanks for posting this issue here! I will try to elaborate it in more details.

Firstly, your description about connection failed status is correct, if our monitoring agent (instances checking node accessibility and ability to transfer data) is failing to establish a p2p connection or exchange data packets via VPN tunnel, then it marks node as connection failed on your dashboard. As a result, your service proposals becomes unavailable to our discovery service responsible for announcing proposals to the network participants meaning no usage and tokens in payment.

Usually, with help of node logs our team helps to reconfigure host network in the way it starts working but thats again a highly dependant on your network setup capabilities.

From the first glance at this situation, it looks like traffic is failing to traverse with use of UDP hole punching to your VMs at Proxmox resulting in such outcome. 

There might several reasons behind and anyway it would require more details to locate this problem better. 

Since I know your current setup, I'll try to reproduce it with similar condition.

BTW, can you please specify your Github issue number if possible? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/1035ypu/connection_failed/j31j7iw/ | Thank you.

tdoodles97,"This is the first post in a long time that has me worried. I was just accepted to a number of veterinary schools in the US & UK, and will begin August 2024. After narrowing down COL, program, affordability of travel, reputation, and much more, I have been deciding on what school I ultimately choose to attend based on tuition amount. But now, I worry, what if the more expensive schools have a more well-rounded curriculum? 

OP, can you please share what vet school you went to?  

And anyone else who sees this, 
What would you choose? UC Davis or North Carolina State?|They won’t convert you into a VA, many CSCs stay in their role for years. 

That being said, I started as a CSC without knowing I wanted to be in vet med. Then I discovered I loved it, so I looked for a job that would train me as an assistant at another GP. I later worked in ER, ICU, in orthopedics, and more. 

I just actively pursued it, and *8 years later I’m currently deciding between several vet schools I’ve been accepted to!|What school are you at?|Ahhh, I applied there this cycle as an OOS student and am waiting to hear back! Other than finals week being brutal, how have you liked your experience so far?|None of those are AVMA accredited though, and if OP and his wife want to come back to the US where she can work as a vet, it’ll be miserable trying to even become eligible to sit for the NAVLE to become a licensed vet in the US. They’ll be working for years as an assistant despite graduating from any of those schools in Europe because AVMA accreditation. 

Some of the best vets I know went to non-AVMA vet schools, so it’s not that the educational quality is any less. But it’s been made abundantly clear how hard it is to become a US licensed vet if someone goes that route instead. 

Side note I have no fricking clue why OP’s wife didn’t get any interview offers. The whole picture isn’t being shown. Maybe her essays are bad or the application is riddled with typos. I’m a first time applicant with similar work history (better GPA but still that’s not the only thing that matters) and I received interviews this cycle from Davis, RVC, & Glasgow, and have received no rejections at all, just waiting to hear from all the others still"

HoovesCarveCraters,"1. Attend and graduate veterinary school
2. Most will do an internship after veterinary school, I'm not sure if they are 100% required but they are recommended. Some will practice for a few years first.
3. Apply for a surgical residency - usually 3 years, yes you will have to publish a paper and present cases
4. Pass boards|There is no ""best""

The ones I have experience with:

1. Banfield - Highly location dependent. I had multiple classmates work there after we graduated and I think only one is still there. She was offered a medical director position straight out of school. They pull you in with salary and signing bonus but can leave you haning.
2. VCA - VERY CORPORATE. I interviewed here and was scared away because there are miles of red tape and you are answering to 40 different people who you have to meet with constantly. Also seem to be pretty stingy in terms of benefits.
3. Vetcor - Worked for a clinic for 2 years. Pretty hands off corporation let us do our thing and didn't bother us. Contract with Idexx was nice for labs. I had a great mentor but I don't think Vetcor has a program per se. Definitely underpay if you don't ask for a good salary up front.
4. NVA - Like Vetcor pretty hands off, no mentorship programs short of finding a clinic that you like. Benefits and pay seem better than Vetcor.|120k is a lot of money. I'd go with LSU.

Something else to think about with RVC - in the UK students don't have to go to college before going to professional school. Even if you are accepted straight out of college, your classmates will be 18-19 year olds."

Among these visits, five consultative site evaluations are slated for proposed veterinary programs vying for accreditation.  
The consultative site visit serves as a crucial step for proposed veterinary colleges, offering them an unofficial report on their readiness to apply for a letter of reasonable assurance. Once deficiencies are addressed, institutions can proceed with a comprehensive site visit to determine eligibility for a letter of reasonable assurance—a pivotal milestone allowing them to begin enrolling students.  
These initiatives underscore the AVMA COE's commitment to fostering excellence in veterinary education and advancing the profession. Among the notable institutions undergoing evaluation is the Rowan University Shreiber School of Veterinary Medicine, with a comprehensive site visit scheduled for April 21-26. The program aims to enroll its inaugural class in fall 2025, pending accreditation.  
Additionally, consultative site visits are slated for prominent institutions such as Clemson University’s proposed College of Veterinary Medicine and Arkansas State University’s proposed College of Veterinary Medicine. These visits, scheduled for May 12-16 and July 7-11, respectively, reflect the growing demand for accredited veterinary programs across the nation.  
Another noteworthy addition to the accreditation pipeline is Chamberlain University's proposed School of Veterinary Medicine in Stockbridge, Georgia. Set for a consultative visit from August 11-15, the program aims to expand access to veterinary medicine education and address future workforce needs in the field.  
Furthermore, the University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES) is set to embark on a transformative journey with its proposed veterinary school. Scheduled for a consultative site visit from July 7-11, UMES aims to become the second historically Black college and university (HBCU) to offer a standalone veterinary program, following in the footsteps of Tuskegee University.  
Meanwhile, Rocky Vista University (RVU) has unveiled plans for its proposed College of Veterinary Medicine in Billings, Montana. The program, set for a consultative site visit from July 21-25, represents a significant milestone in RVU's commitment to expanding access to veterinary education.  
Lastly, Hanover College in Indiana is poised to launch a revolutionary hybrid accelerated veterinary program, pending accreditation. Backed by a $5.9 million grant from Indiana, the program seeks to revolutionize veterinary education by offering a blend of online lectures, hands-on laboratory experiences, and distributed clinical education opportunities.|How to navigate the ECFG program

Far-Assignment-733,"If you want to be a legit “zoo veterinarian” who works at major AZA accredited zoos in large cities, there’s tons of training involved. You’ll need your DVM (generally 4 years) where you’ll learn almost nothing about zoo species. You’ll also need a 1 year rotating internship and possibly a 1 year speciality internship, followed by a 3 year residency to actually get trained in how to do zoo animal medicine since vet school will mostly teach you dog-cat-equine-and some food animal. Zoo veterinarians don’t get payed well at all, and from what I’ve heard, the work-life balance isn’t great either. Also, the residency programs are among the most competitive programs for any speciality in veterinary medicine (I think the acceptance rate is like 3% or around there most years). If you want to work at backyard zoos, you just need a DVM, and not the other stuff (ie board certification). Not trying to be discouraging, but zoologic medicine is definitely one of the hardest if not the hardest field to break into and to stay in within veterinary medicine.|I’m a 3rd year veterinary student who is considering small animal specialty practice.

Not sure how someone is expected to live on $35-$38k/year in a mid-sized city or urban area. You literally won’t get approved for an apartment. I also really think there needs to be more help for couples who are looking to apply to the match during the same cycle. They have this in human medicine. I guess our relationships don’t matter.|I would think no unless there was reason to assume they would abuse the medication and you dispensed it anyways.|I’m currently a 3rd year student at an AVMA accredited institution that also has a teaching hospital. I definitely agree with you that this is a problem. New vet schools popping up everywhere that don’t actually have the resources to properly educate students. I can only hope that the AVMA continues to be highly selective with which programs receive accreditation.|There are so many problems with the veterinary professional associate proposal. Who in their right mind is gonna go and get a masters degree to be a glorified vet tech? Also, the idea that a DVM would be legally responsible for the VPA’s performance is terrifying. Being a veterinarian is already one of the most stressful jobs you could have as evidenced by the high suicide rate. Making vets legally responsible for the mistakes of unqualified pseudo-doctors would increase veterinarians’ stress levels significantly. The answer to the vet shortage question is to improve and expand the pool of DVM programs, not create these weird new positions.|There is already a critical shortage of veterinarians in the United States. This shortage is projected to continue to get worse and worse. If you pay vets less, that’s not exactly going to help the situation.|Focus on getting into vet school first. Once you’re in vet school, you can start to think about specialties. I thought I knew what I wanted to do going into vet school, but it turned out not to be the case.|A couple of things here. First, a lot of places use the pro-sal model for compensating associates, including new grads. This means that salary is only one part of your income. If you look at the most recent AVMA annual survey (https://www.avma.org/news/veterinary-starting-salaries-rise-2023-educational-debt-holds-steady), the average starting compensation for new grads in small animal is $133k. So, what you really need to be looking at is what is the compensation structure that is being offered. Is it $100k straight salary, or is it $100k with 21% production on top of that? Big difference between the two. Also, job ads are just that, job ads. A clinic can offer whatever they want on indeed…doesn’t mean anyone is going to sign for that. I’m always surprised by the number of posts we get on this subreddit from practice managers and recruiters who don’t understand what compensation is considered industry-standard nowadays. Bottom line is, veterinarians are in extremely high demand right now as there is a nation-wide shortage. If I was a new grad going into small animal (unless planing to work in a very rural or low-cost of living area) I would not even entertain any offers with starting salary of less than $120k. New grads often don’t make very much in production on top of that because they aren’t super efficient. Once you start producing enough billings to earn production incentives, you should be looking anywhere in the $150k-200k range for an experienced associate unless in a very rural or poor area.|According to data from the AVMA, in small animal practice, the average compensation for a new graduate is $133k/year now. So 100k for a new grad is kind of the absolute minimum.|Becoming a licensed vet tech does not take 4 years of full-time schooling.|The point of my comment was not to suggest that I think LVT pay is adequate, it is not.|I could be wrong since I am a small animal person (vet student), but this is what I know. You really don’t need to specialize to work with food animals generally speaking. There are far fewer food animal vets than there are small animal vets in the United States, so there are going to be more opportunities of all kinds for small animal-related things. Making traditional internships and residencies required to work in a field with a huge shortage of vets already would be a terrible idea for obvious reasons. Additionally, I don’t think that most producers would necessarily pay more for the services of a “specialist” than a regular veterinarian, so spending several years after graduation in training financially wouldn’t make sense for new vets.

If you look on the VIRMP (https://www.virmp.org) it does appear that there are internships and residency opportunities available in food animal medicine. My guess is that these are really designed for people who want to go into academia/research more so than for folks to want to go into practice, but they do exist.

There are specialist certifications you can get through ABVP in beef, dairy, and food animal. However, since these are through ABVP, it’s done through a clinical route rather than a traditional residency program.
Here is a link to the AVMA recognized specialties. https://www.avma.org/education/veterinary-specialties

There are lots of ways you can learn about food animal medicine beyond just what you are doing in vet school. I don’t know what program you are at, but most programs have various food animal clubs that participate in activities such as palpations and pregnancy checks, lambing, calving, farm call ride- alongs, etc. They also have guest speakers who are knowledgeable in the field. I would look into opportunities like these to learn more during your didactic years of vet school.|I’ve taken about the same number (a few more) but they were spread out more than yours were thankfully.|It really depends on the program you are in and how efficient you are with your studying. In general, I wouldn’t plan on being able to work any more than like 8-10 hours a week unless you do not value sleep or sanity."
Self-Taught-Pillock,"It depends on the practice and also the area. I didn’t work in veterinary medicine too long, but the practice that employed me made it a condition of my employment that my tattoos (pet-related tattoos) were covered while on site. It’s important to note that while such a requirement seems stuffy and of outdated sentiments, they didn’t have a moment’s hesitation hiring me or anyone with tattoos. They only wanted them covered. At the very most, I believe that’s what you’re facing: merely covering tattoos instead of not being hired because of them.

Most practices don’t care. I had tattooed acquaintances at other practices in this rather religious and conservative area that didn’t have to cover, even one with a septum piercing that wasn’t required to hide it. And long after I left veterinary medicine, I had to take my own little baby dog to a specialist clinic for a hemilaminectomy, and the specialist clinic (that had about 50-60% Mormon clientele) had plenty of tattooed employees that weren’t required to cover while at work.

What people will notice and remember is the light in your eyes."
liase,"Is your in province vet school not an option? My tuition for vet school was like $6k CAD a year once all the OSAP grants were factored in, so very affordable. Granted it is very competitive and this was about a  decade ago..|As a Canadian vet, 100% agree. Go in province or don't do it.|Honestly, given the costs of going out of country and how much vets make, I would look into trying to become more competitive at your home school. Can you bump up your marks? A master's? More extra curriculars?|Impractical in what way?|Sure I get that impatience but also, I think you should try to look logically at the situation. 300k+ debt is huge and will take years (decades?) and thousands of interest. I would be trying to give your home school it's best shot - if you think you have any reasonable chance of getting in. 
I know plenty of colleagues who have had good educations out of country and are dealing with the debts in various ways (family primarily but also loans) but boy, that is a lot of loan to tackle right out of school|I went to OVC and didn't go to Guelph for my undergrad, and neither did a lot of my classmates. I have friends who worked with the admission team, there is no Guelph advantage. That being said, people who want to be vets from a young age tend to choose Guelph for their undergrad so there is a higher percentage from there. 
I agree though, it is very competitive. But not impossible. For a $300k difference though, I would be making getting into an in province school my priority|As a vet of 9 years, graduating from OVC, I could not echo this more. 
Back before vet school, with some rose coloured glasses on, I might've had that ""whatever it takes""  attitude about becoming a vet. In hindsight, I feel extremely grateful to have gotten into to OVC and would NOT have become a vet if I had to go overseas. $300k debt is insane. Crippling. And on top of that, trying to afford life itself (house prices in Canada are insane). Nope. I love being a vet but it would not be worth it. I would go into human medicine, dentistry, something else."

fire4ice,"Considering that microbiology is a part of veterinary medicine.... If you want to be a veterinarian, then you're really going to have to learn to like biology....|Try seeing if you can get a job as a vet assistant or kennel tech and start getting veterinary hours now. A lot of my classmates didn't realize the requirements of becoming a veterinarian and got a rude awakening by our professors. Some of them did cry, since our college is in a smaller community and there's not a ton of veterinarians to work with. It'll take a lot of stress off. It'll also put you on the clinical side of things and you'll know if you like it or hate it. The first thing I got trained to do as a vet assistant was how to get histories, so it is a fair amount of talking. 

Some of my classes are really hard. They actually are having me take the same biology classes as all the premed students and it's a lot of information and reading. So it can be stressful. 

One of my classes is where professors come in from the ADVS department and talk about jobs other than being a veterinarian. The most interesting of all the professors was a professor with a doctorate in beef nutrition. She had gotten accepted into veterinary school but fell in love with research. She runs some really interesting research projects at our school like what poisonous plants do the rumen of a cow. So she encourages to get involved in any research project at the school. 

Also have a backup plan for if you're not accepted into vet school so you didn't just waste all the time of going through undergrad. There's also a lot of competition when it comes to it so make sure you're doing all you can to be the best candidate. My school has a pre -vet club that will hold mock interviews, events on how to suture, volunteer events, and lots of other really cool stuff so try to see if your potential college has any other similar clubs."
ShiraOokami19,Likely clinics interested in hiring or recruiters/scouts looking to connect you to clinics that are hiring.

ohfuckmeee,"I'd say the answer to this question is completely dependent on what you would have to pay for said minority shares and the EBITA margin of the business. Think of it like any other investment

If you have to pay top dollar for the shares, or the EBITA margin of the business sucks, then you might be better off putting the money in a different investment and just working there.

If you're getting the shares at a discount rate, the EBITA margin is healthy, and you feel comfortable in the stability of the business, then probably a good idea if you don't need the money right now.

An additional factor is I'd also try to estimate how much this will obligate you to engage in managing the business and then if you're not going to get additional compensation for that, do a mental cost benefit analysis of the time you'll invest in the managing compared to the dividend revenue and expected cap gains of the equity. If that math doesn't add up then I'd probably not go forward either."

Everything will change, maybe several times. I thought I wanted to do poultry, then exotics, then large animal surgery... I'm now in small animal ER and I love it. Just focus on getting into vet school and experiencing lots of different things.|I was an assistant in college to start. I literally passed out the first time I saw a dog neuter... like a tech had to catch me and carry me out of the OR and I woke up in the treatment area. I struggled to do everything including syringes, setting up fluid bags, etc. Im now an ER doctor regularly running the entire hospital at night alone (with techs) with 10+ inpatients and multiple outpatients. Everyone starts somewhere! Just keep learning and you'll get there."
Sea-Witch,"A kitten that young with that many problems would have died much sooner and more painfully had he not come in to your clinic. How lucky was this small, broken baby to have been so loved. Even if you caused urethral trauma, it wasn't wrong to try and unblock a blocked kitten as that would have killed him outright. I had a string of 5 blocked cats not make it for various wild reasons (acute on chronic, also had a foreign body, were feral cats and too far gone, etc). How lucky for that kitten that he even got a chance at life. He was likely never going to regain use of the back end and his passing was inevitable but you at least gave him a chance and that is the beauty of our profession."

NootinWootin_,"To answer your question about the “send a message”- it’s okay to ask that way. I had to do that to ask about shadowing a vet and they got back to me pretty quick. If you want a faster answer though I would call or go in person.|Yes!! I agree! Volunteering is necessary when it comes to applying to some vet schools. Yea it sucks that it doesn’t pay the bills but it’s an easy way to get experience and form connections.|Even if it was a matter of confidence, that doesn’t mean that they have a right to yell or disrespect you. You have options. One is to speak up and tell them to stop insulting you and just help you by explaining what to do. Two is to leave that toxic work environment.

I'm going to spin up a node in the near future, based on the comments below I'll use regular mode, but the machine I'll use is already behind a VPN, which is why I have no reservations what-so-ever running it

Also, the user interface is pretty great."

Doesn't look like you have configured Metamask correctly. 

Please note you must first enable your wallet under the Polygon Network and then import custom token MYST from the Polygon Network in order to see the received tokens in your balance.​﻿​﻿Below is a guide on how to do so:​﻿  
Link Metamask to the Polygon network   
Link MetaMask to the Polygon Network​﻿  
Open MetaMask console and switch the connected blockchain (network) by clicking on the tab saying Ethereum Mainnet, we need to add the Polygon network.  
Scroll down until you find Custom RPC.  
Enter in the Polygon Mainnet settings as follows:  
Network Name: Polygon Mainnet  
New RPC URL: https://polygon-rpc.com/  
Chain ID: 137  
Currency Symbol (optional): MATIC  
Block Explorer URL (optional): https://polygonscan.com/​﻿  
You have now connected to the Polygon mainnet with your Metamask Wallet! You can now interact with Polygon tokens like $MYST while connected to Polygon. Note that transactions on the Polygon network requires its native token MATIC which will be used as gas fee. You can get MATIC tokens in any DEX available in the Ethereum Mainnet (such as at @Uniswap) and then bridge the tokens to Polygon.

Doesn't look like you have configured Metamask correctly. 

Please note you must first enable your wallet under the Polygon Network and then import custom token MYST from the Polygon Network in order to see the received tokens in your balance.​﻿​﻿Below is a guide on how to do so:​﻿  
Link Metamask to the Polygon network   
Link MetaMask to the Polygon Network​﻿  
Open MetaMask console and switch the connected blockchain (network) by clicking on the tab saying Ethereum Mainnet, we need to add the Polygon network.  
Scroll down until you find Custom RPC.  
Enter in the Polygon Mainnet settings as follows:  
Network Name: Polygon Mainnet  
New RPC URL: https://polygon-rpc.com/  
Chain ID: 137  
Currency Symbol (optional): MATIC  
Block Explorer URL (optional): https://polygonscan.com/​﻿  
You have now connected to the Polygon mainnet with your Metamask Wallet! You can now interact with Polygon tokens like $MYST while connected to Polygon. Note that transactions on the Polygon network requires its native token MATIC which will be used as gas fee. You can get MATIC tokens in any DEX available in the Ethereum Mainnet (such as at @Uniswap) and then bridge the tokens to Polygon.  
   
   
Adding MYST token to MetaMask on the Polygon Mainnet   
﻿To add MYST token to your MetaMask, go to the main MetaMask account page. Click on the assets tab, where you’ll see Add Token at the bottom.  
﻿After you click Add Token, navigate to the Custom Token tab and manually enter the MYST token details. Copy the Token Contract Address (please find below) and paste that onto the Custom Token tab on MetaMask.

Please note you must first enable your wallet under the Polygon Network and then import custom token MYST from the Polygon Network in order to see the received tokens in your balance.​﻿​﻿Below is a guide on how to do so:​﻿  
Link Metamask to the Polygon network   
Link MetaMask to the Polygon Network​﻿  
Open MetaMask console and switch the connected blockchain (network) by clicking on the tab saying Ethereum Mainnet, we need to add the Polygon network.  
Scroll down until you find Custom RPC.  
Enter in the Polygon Mainnet settings as follows:  
Network Name: Polygon Mainnet  
New RPC URL: https://polygon-rpc.com/  
Chain ID: 137  
Currency Symbol (optional): MATIC  
Block Explorer URL (optional): https://polygonscan.com/​﻿  
You have now connected to the Polygon mainnet with your Metamask Wallet! You can now interact with Polygon tokens like $MYST while connected to Polygon. Note that transactions on the Polygon network requires its native token MATIC which will be used as gas fee. You can get MATIC tokens in any DEX available in the Ethereum Mainnet (such as at @Uniswap) and then bridge the tokens to Polygon.  
   
   
Adding MYST token to MetaMask on the Polygon Mainnet   
﻿To add MYST token to your MetaMask, go to the main MetaMask account page. Click on the assets tab, where you’ll see Add Token at the bottom.  
﻿After you click Add Token, navigate to the Custom Token tab and manually enter the MYST token details. Copy the Token Contract Address (please find below) and paste that onto the Custom Token tab on MetaMask.  
​﻿MYST token details:  
Token Contract Address on PolygonScan : 0x1379e8886a944d2d9d440b3d88df536aea08d9f3

When consumers connect and consume data they will pay Hermes (an internal protocol) and in turn it will pay in MYST to the node runner. 

So that is the separation gap node runner never know the wallet address of consumers and vise versa.

This will make changes to how your NAT functions which you might want to read up on. 

You can check your NAT status at the link below.

Your own nodeUI already provides you with logs of time, date and duration.

A node runner from Germany had been contacted from a copyright holder about data they had transferred. They were able to respond with the data from the NodeUI and that resolved their situation. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/swx7dd/making_running_a_mysterium_node_legal_and_safe_in/hxtk443/ | There has been more than one person in Germany who was contacted by a rights holder and in all cases using the logs they already have none of the cases went any further.

Torrenting or anything else, none of the data exists on your system.

You know there is Whitelisting and that will solve the above issue, it's up to you on what you choose. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/swx7dd/making_running_a_mysterium_node_legal_and_safe_in/hxwd0d7/ | Then you can always pay for the registration.

Currently Polygon free have shot up due to NFT gaming so most of that went to pay network fees. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/rz4ipg/not_worth_it_specially_after_the_settlement_fee/hrwpa3p/ | You can find a list of where to purchase here, [https://mysterium.network/token/](https://mysterium.network/token/) but as has been mentioned by [/u/JimnyJones](https://www.reddit.com/user/JimnyJones) HitBTC is currently probably the best one to use. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/ior4oi/it_sounds_like_gold/g4jhmpv/ | Mysterium Network begins its official token migration today, 31st August 2020. This will be a 1:1 token migration, so no new tokens will be created. Legacy tokens will not be supported in the network, so you will need to migrate your tokens before topping up in-app.

[http://bit.ly/MYST-migration-starts](http://bit.ly/MYST-migration-starts)

TL;DR:

💰1:1 Migration - no new tokens created

📑Manual migration for tokens on decentralised exchanges and ethereum wallets

🚀We're working with HitBTC to automagically migrate your tokens. Hold tight for more information

Find out how to upgrade your token:

Staking 1000MYST will allow you to earn up to 10DAI per day. Staking 500MYST will allow you to earn 5DAI per day. So the amount you staking is proportional to the limit of DAI you can earn per day.

All countries have different laws and that why there is Whitelisting of nodes available.

When a consumer agrees to use the service they do so on the agreement that they only use it for legal purposes.
If a consumer should do anything illegal then they are the ones committing an offence, not the node.

This is also why whitelisting of nodes exist so this would not be an issue. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/q400jq/risk_of_allowing_illegal_activity_that_makes_you/hfv6kdb/ | With the upcoming release on mainnet will original ICO backers see any benefits / acknowledgements? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/gc3zxw/ama_jaro_šatkevic_head_of_product_9_am_est_5th/fpivrm4/ | Our latest partnership is with Parsiq and they are a big part of our Tokenomics 2.0 with Matic Network allowing cheaper P2P payments, there is also a partnership with Storj Labs.  You can find out more information on all of theses at the link below.

Currently it's not possible to forward port, but will be something that's looked at. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/omn2vp/reaching_adoptation/h5zrs4y/ | The bounty payments are pretty much currently subsidized by Mysterium. Once the launch on MainNet users will be directly paying for what they use.  
That's todays price so it would be incorrect to project that over the year since the price has had major fluctuations.   
The details of tokenomics 2.0 has been released and that does go into how nodes will be paid in the future.   
You can read over it here.

MainNet has been released so all nodes will restart at 0. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/qyxky2/im_not_earning_anything_for_completed_sessions/hls85ey/ | 1.In current Mainnet release, new nodes will have to stake some small amount of MYST (between 0.1 and 10) to proof skin in the game. This stake will work differently than one described in Tokenomics 2.0.

NOTE: Testnet3 nodes migrated into mainnet will be not required to stake and will be registered for free (Mysterium team will cover blockchain fees required for node registration)  


2. An update should be all that is required. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/qwqzms/changes_with_mainnet_launch/hl4n25n/ | Upgrade to version 0.67.1 if that's not your latest version.

If once done and it still happens then report the issue from with the nodeUI. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/q8nr4g/is_it_just_my_node/hgqewe7/ | Currently there are 2 bounties which have maximum earnings of 100MYST And 30MYST per month.

You can use MEW or Metamask, eventually when you wish to move any MYST that you earn you will need to use ETH to pay the gas fees. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/qbgzr8/payout_question/hhbjkgf/ | You don't mention which version that you have now but since you mentioned openVPN then it was an older version.
Current version is 0.62.1. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/pizot7/was_there_an_update/hbypob6/ | Your pricing looks ok. some of it will come down to which country your node is from. Some countries are more popular than others.

https://docs.mysterium.network/token/bounty/#gatsby-focus-wrapper ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/of5yas/am_i_reaching_my_earning_potential/h4aq5pp/ | Test failed is not necessarily an issue. Did you try to connect to your own node?  
 *experiment-natpunching=false/true*   true is for UPnP and NATPunching.

panic_ye_not,"Interesting. I also don't know how I got to this sub, because I'm a dentist lol.


But in dentistry in my area, I think most dentists go by ""Dr. _____"" with their staff and even with other dentists unless they're personally close. Shortly after graduation I even told people they could call me by my first name and they still called me Dr. ______ because the norm is already so established in most offices I've been to. 


So if I introduce myself as Dr. ____ to staff or tell them how I want to be addressed, and they ignore it? That's not only unusual, it would be an open insult---that is, in my situation. 


I'm not sure if there's a similar culture in veterinary medicine in OP's area. It's an important ""if"" to consider. "

ihatethomasnichini,"People do not consider debt load to quality of life and work ratio enough in this industry. Im a BC grad from WCVM, minimal debt when finishing school (60k), love what I do, and got lucky. Sorry, but $300k+ is fucking insane for this field. This job is hard and doesn't pay what it should for what you take on. Cost of living in Canada alone right now is very, very expensive so you need to really, really look at the scope of practice and what you expect lifestyle-wise before going into this industry. No, life is not just about money, but it plays a huge role. Consider moving to a less competitive province for placement before seeking abroad because of cost. If thats not an option and you love medicine regardless, consider human medicine - seriously. You're likely competitive enough, its a super challenging and interesting and diverse field."

I know it seems stupidly obvious but not having used Metamask and Mystnodes previously, (and only used to crypto exchanges), I wasn't really aware there's a difference in what network you need to be on to see the commits.

Makes you wonder why they didn't mention that as a step when setting up Metamask here since, as you say, it defaults to the ETH network:

alittlemouth,"Rowan hasn't released their tuition rates yet, but I'd imaging at least $50k/year, even if in-state.  Yes, surgeons can make $300k+, but keep in mind that in order to be a surgeon you have to complete vet school, a rotating internship, 1+ surgical specialty internships, and a 3-year residency, which are historically not very well paid (though some of that is changing, depending on where you go).

That is as much as Penn and Cornell, to go to a school without an associated hospital. Insane.|I guess I have huge concerns about a school that partners with “over 250” sites for clinical year and how they ensure every one of those sites is providing excellent clinical education that meets their standards. I guess there’s no better way to gauge success other than NAVLE pass rates (UA's was only 72%, failing to meet the goal for accreditation), which will be interesting to monitor once these new schools start churning out new grads.

Edited to add:
Just looking at tuition only, UA's resident tuition is $47k/year (total over 3 years = $141k), non-resident is $73k (total over 3 years = $219k).  UC Davis, which is currently the #1 ranked school in the US, is $35k for the first 3 years, and $39k for the 4th, for a total of $143k for residents.  For non-residents total is $192k.|I’d focus your externships on procedural things: dentistry and surgery. Mentorship in these areas is really hit or miss once you graduate.|I dunno, man. I just find some of this so hard to believe. Being told you’re a waste of space? Perhaps you think people view you that way, but there’s no way someone actually said that to you. 

It sounds like maybe you didn’t choose the right vet school if there’s such a lack of curriculum in which you’re interested. When I was in school there were entire blocks and courses dedicated to production and farm medicine, exotics, chickens, and yes, amphibians/reptiles/fish. I will say that there wasn’t a whole lot re: aquaculture, but I think that’s because of how little need there is in that field. 

It makes sense to hire another small animal researcher: companion animals are where the majority of research is being done, and that is the sphere in which the majority of veterinarians work. 

If you want to go into a niche field, you need to understand that you will be responsible for seeking out niche experiences.|>it’s standard procedure to handle all paperwork and financial matters PRIOR to euthanasia. I’ve never had one single client raise an eyebrow about jt. Our CSRs always get that part out of the way first, so the owner can focus on their pet and not have to worry about anything else. No one wants to stop in the lobby to pay their bill after they’ve cried their eyes out and lost their pet. If you’re losing clients regarding this issue specifically, maybe it’s the approach that’s needs fine-tuning, not necessarily the protocol.

Agreed. We’ve even designed our hospital so our euthanasia/comfort room has a separate exit so clients can go directly to the parking lot afterwards without having to go through the lobby.|Definitely not, but keep in mind that you are also the patient’s advocate and will sometimes notice things the vet didn’t, and it’s okay to speak up! Sometimes my best diagnostic tool is the tech who felt a lump while carrying in a critter, or who noticed a positional nystagmus while taking rads that I couldn’t elicit on exam. A good tech who is always watching and monitoring is priceless!|Whichever cardiologist is well known and willing to write her a fantastic letter. That’s it. Nothing else matters.|This sounds pretty nitpicky, TBH.  Your first step is to sit down with the MD and define your roles.  A good MD will often have a lot of overlap with a practice manager/hospital director because they want to be involved in management of the hospital as a whole rather than simply giving medical direction.|What will you do if you don't do this?  I'm always pointing out sunk cost fallacy, but in this case it seems insane to me to not just finish and at least have the degree to show for it.  Even if you don't practice clinical medicine you can go into industry, research, shelter med, at-home euthanasia, etc.  

It's also important to determine if you are miserable because of vet school, or if you are just miserable.  If it's the latter, quitting ain't gonna help.|Metronidazole use was a hot topic at both VECCS and ACVIM this year.  One speaker presented a host of studies that essentially said *nothing* you do improves the course of acute diarrhea (metro, probiotics, bland diet, etc). Another lecture recommended using metro when hematochezia is present due to its anti-inflammatory properties. I think there is still a lot of controversy, and I think the anti-inflammatory effects are honestly difficult to measure. 

Sure, the number of days to resolution might be the same, but is the patient more comfortable? Is the intestinal glycocalyx better preserved if there is less inflammation?  We don’t know those things. 

I use metro for appropriate infections, concern for intestinal bacterial translocation, and when there is hematochezia. Whether that’s right or not, I don’t know, but I don’t think anyone really does at this point. 

Prazosin, on the other hand, is something I don’t touch anymore. Even before there was new data, I was always shocked at how many people prescribed it without checking a blood pressure first, especially in sick UO kitties. Make it make sense.|As an aside, what's your umbrage with gabapentin?  I use it regularly as an adjunct as I like the sedation it provides for a lot of things (ie; chills out FLUTD cats, keeps cruciate dogs more easily rested, etc.).|Where are you that you're able to do a CRP bedside or do you send it out, wait for results, then have clients come back to pick up metro if elevated?|Prazosin can cause hypotension.

I'll always give 3-5 days of an NSAID even if they decline blood work...I just educate and document, but I don't think it's fair to a dog to not get an anti-inflammatory when it's indicated, especially after surgery!

No amount of money is worth risking your license.|If you’re feeling burnt out an internship is not the right move here.|As a data point, I recently hired two doctors; one went through the VEG program, the other through an NVA program. The VEG doctor worked 4 overnights per week for the entire last 3 months of her program, and the NVA doc worked five 12 hour shifts, weds-sun, for the entire 6 month program and they were both burnt to a CRISP afterwards, so make sure you fully understand what your schedule and required hours will be prior to signing on the dotted line.|Thankfully they now work for me, and do 3x12, fixed schedule. 😊|I don't think your surgical technique was the problem - the problem was that this was an adult dog with a big ol' scrotum, and even with the best technique, some of these will develop a hematoma, sometimes a HUGE one.

That is my right and if it’s not honored, I’m gone.|Hey doc - fellow doc here - you need to go and talk to the office manager as a first step. Your entire environment there is toxic so it’s not just you. Unfortunately, very likely your office manager is a part of the toxicity so you may not get very far with that person and you may have to go higher up. I don’t know what your structure is but there will be someone higher up. remember this is work not a friendship, so don’t think you can bond with them and make friends with them, you don’t have to. But you can look them in the eye, and with a very pleasant smile on your face you can say hey I am a doctor, I do know what I’m doing, please put a cool pack on that incision as soon as the patient’s temperature is high enough and they’re able to thermal regulate. You also might check and see if the technicians have their own manager because I guarantee that toxicity between that entire team and all its members. Go and talk to the other doctors as well.

BBG1308,"High speed scanners make quick work of this.

It helps if you separate out the actual medical record from other documents such as consent forms so that when you want to look at history, you get nothing but the chart notes. You certainly can and should save all those other documents, but just do it in a separate file.

What's slow is making sure that if you rely on your Cornerstone database to give alerts such as diagnostic codes or allergies or adverse reactions or handling recommendations or existing authorized prescription refills...each record has to be looked at and those things manually entered.

Our DVMs loathe looking at scanned records. Even \~ eight years down line we still have some paper charts because of this. If the patient's chart is more than an inch thick...hard nope on scanning. If the patient is of a certain age...hard nope on scanning. If the patient hasn't been seen in two years...hard nope on scanning.

Your time is more valuable spent generating income for the practice than scanning records. See patients. Deal with paper charts for the ones that are enormous or are likely to pass soonish or may never come back. Pay someone else to scan the rest. You still have to have someone (you or a well-trained tech) to read the record and enter any necessary database info.|> I also see many people saying RVT school does not transfer to DVM school in any way.

It doesn't count at all towards a four year graduate degree in veterinary medicine.  But veterinary students usually complete a four year bachelor's degree prior to applying to veterinary school.  

If the RVT program is at an accredited institution such as a community college, some of their credits can be transferred to a four year university and may help them achieve their bachelor's in less than four full years.

RVT school is primarily a vocational program. Thus the ""T"" for technician. They don't diagnose or prescribe.

Don't get me wrong. RVTs are worth their weight in gold. But it's a completely different level of education and type of training than what a veterinarian receives."

I have AdGuard Home setup on my pi zero, I guess I can check the traffic thru there thank you for the advice.

https://docs.mysterium.network/faq|You should not have any problems if you turn ""Public"" off. My node has been up for 1 month and never had any problems yet. 

Second, I also want to turn Public on but I have to read and understand very well on ""how to run an exit node"" https://dvpnalliance.org/exit-node/

This is their original guide on how to run an exit node. 

There are deffinitely  important information in that guide.|How are you able to reach 50-100 MYST with one node?|Hmm. Okay I appreciate the answer. Its been 11 hours and 58 minutes. Only 2.87MB used. That's very interesting.|I did a clean pi OS installation and it seems to be working normal right now. Made 5 mysts in the past 4-5 days. 

How do you see it on your wallet tho? When I put the transaction ID on etherscan nothing shows. Even when I put my wallet address on etherscan I still can't see any transactions. 

I check my metamask wallet and I don't see any myst either. But when I check the node it gives me a Transaction Id with the date and time. Where did the tokens go?|Okay. Thank you|the external address is the same as my metamask wallet address. I didn't do anything specific. Do I need to do anything specific?

When I log into metamask I only see; ETH wallet address that is it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

EDIT:

So when I go to Bridge section in Metamask, It gives me an option to transfer tokens from one network to another.

When I select Polygon (From this network) I can see my MYST tokens around 4 MYST tokens which is about a dollar.

But when I click the Metamask extension on google chrome I do not see any myst tokens. All I see is

0 ETH.

&#x200B;

EDIT 2:

Somehow I managed to do it. I went to metamask portfolio then I select Bridge. Over there I clicked ""Switch networks in Metamask"" > Then I select Polygon. After that I was able to see it in my portfolio. I clicked Myst in my portfolio then I clicked ""Add to metamask""

So when I go to Bridge section in Metamask, It gives me an option to transfer tokens from one network to another.

QuietNightER,"Great stuff here. I think we are headed toward a reckoning at some point. From the AVMA state of the profession the number of graduates electing to do internships has been dropping since 2012 and 2023 saw the lowest number since 2004. Eventually we may not have enough specialists practicing to support the training of new specialists.

Another big problem is the 'screw you, got mine' mentality. Whenever I bring up challenges of veterinary students or interns/residents to the state VMA or at conferences people basically laugh and dismiss complaints. Last time I looked at the AVMA officer positions the requirements were basically be an older generation veterinarian as you needed so many years of AVMA membership to even qualify. Those people don't care about new veterinarians.

I'm not sure about every specialty but at least with ECC I can take a corporate job and get paid just as much and often more than a specialist. At some point the 4+ years of fast food wages doesn't make the end result worth it.|I would try reaching out to faculty at whatever university you went to and see if you can get in contact with their radiologist for suggestions (I did this for cardio a few years back). I have the same Thrall book and its the only radiology one I have so I can't add much there.

[https://www.veterinaryradiology.net/](https://www.veterinaryradiology.net/) hasn't updated in awhile but they used to have cases pretty regularly. I am pretty sure all of their images come from [http://mirc.veterinaryradiology.net/query](http://mirc.veterinaryradiology.net/query) although the previous website would be better for testing yourself.

Antech used to have a pretty big radiology CE section, but I havent seen anything about it since the candy company bought them. Looks like its still on their website though [https://info.antechimagingservices.com/education/ais-academy/](https://info.antechimagingservices.com/education/ais-academy/)|University of Minnesota has an entire dissection walkthrough with pictures (http://vanat.cvm.umn.edu/carnLabs/). If you were really wanted to get a hands on view though you might try reaching out to either a tech school or vet school admin or course coordinator and ask to audit the lab portion of the course. Probably no one has asked that before and they may be skeptical so I would share some of your work when you do this.

As far as books are concerned we used Guide to the Dissection of the Dog by Lahunta and I thought it was great. For large animal we used the Clinical Dissection Guide for Large Animals by Constantinescu but I preferred Pasquini's Anatomy of Domestic Animals or Budras' bovine and horse anatomy books.|Just to level some expectations you might have, there is a lot of bureaucracy in university hospitals and it's not unlike corporate practice in many regards as your hospital ultimately answers to someone from main campus. For example we don't carry oral bup for cats because then we can charge them for multiple bup ampoules instead. This is probably location dependent much like corporate practices, and I've only worked at one university so take that with a grain of salt.

From what I have seen my university cares little about past experience. We get a lot of fresh grads which may be in part due to a local veterinary technician school and the university itself offering a veterinary technologist program. You may find you are underutilized as students will be given many tasks that technicians might usually get. It is an amazing place to learn though and also a great place to work on a VTS. If you know what department/specialty you want to work with I could give more information.

From your perspective you can easily spin the change from specialty/ER to GP to university specialty/ER as you wanted to try something new with GP and realized your passion was with whatever specialty you prefer.|I've enjoyed my time; there are a lot of great learning experiences. If you are applying to a public university the salary information is public so you can find out what others are making to give you a basis on what they pay.

I had a similar experience to your friend trying to work on my VTS at Bluepearl. It's a lot easier at the university hospital for a few reasons, it's easy to reach out to colleagues, its a university so most doctors there love to teach, and generally management was more supportive if I wanted to do whatever procedure for my case log. Staff level depends on the department, a lot of the specialties rely on their students so may only have a few technicians, others have many technicians but they're relegated to grunt work and treatments. I don't think they have a problem filling positions as they pay several dollars more than surrounding hospitals.

Our ICU is very boring for technicians as they basically come in just for monitoring/treatments. All of the fun stuff is done at whatever department they transfer from."

A quick google also shows apparently it doesn't require [hardware virtualization support](https://www.unixtutorial.org/does-docker-need-hardware-virtualization/)|You should be able to do this by running multiple instances with their own data storage directories -- For example, the command running on mine is  
```
/usr/bin/myst --config-dir=/etc/mysterium-node --script-dir=/etc/mysterium-node --data-dir=/var/lib/mysterium-node --runtime-dir=/var/run/mysterium-node --p2p.listen.ports=51820:52075 --experiment-natpunching=false --keystore.lightweight daemon
```
So you would need to supply different arguments for the `config-dir`, `script-dir`, `data-dir` and `runtime-dir`. You may also need to sort out something with the keystore, but that's not as immediately obvious.

RamblaPacifica,"Sounds like your co-workers are already ""soft-bailing"" on this clinic's management.  I'd follow suit.  A higher salary isn't worth yours or anyone's mental health.

If you cared about this new management you could give them a come-to-jesus level of feedback, but if they continue to make no changes for the better, it's time to leave.  You can't make anyone care, but you'd have peace of mind knowing that you at least tried.  It could be that the owners of the clinic want this branch to fail for whatever reason."

thatplantistoxic,"Last year they had a timeline on the website with the date that matches come out|I’m not there but from what I’ve heard academic internships can be harder with longer hours and more expectations of interns. I’m at a private practice though so can’t speak on it personally|Of course!! The position wouldn’t exist if it wasn’t important! I’m a vet now but started as a vet assistant and it was my FAVORITE job.|Amazing|I say this bc (as someone who worked er and is now in my rotating internship) you freeze in the moment. When that lateral dog comes in, you know what to do in theory but in the moment you lose everything. I’m much more comfortable now compared to when I started but it is still nerve racking. 

Don’t let it distract you from going into er. I just say do an internship first.

Edit: I do have a friend from vet school who went straight into er. But she’s working at the hospital she has worked at for years and has established mentors|I think you’re doing everything right. Don’t feel bad about the money side of it because typically when animals come in that critical they’re going to be spending a lot more money (hospitalization, etc. it’s not usually a quick fix or OP procedure). 

The only thing I would change would be instead of saying “fluffy can’t breathe” I would change it to “fluffy is in a very critical state right now and the doctor needs approval to perform life saving measures such as ivc placement, fluid blood, possibly intubation, etc.”|A date that will forever be seared into my brain lol|Agree with skipping the VA program, just start with tech school. Make it clear to your work that you would like to expand your work. If they are not supportive of this then find another hospital"

If so, are you able to share with us who they are, how you're collaborating and what that ultimately means for Mysterium? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/84sptz/mysterium_network_reddit_ama_march_2018/dvuqpdr/ | If you had to estimate based on your current development trajectory, the time-frame for a main net release, what would your estimate be?
It might be best to go with an answer of ""during the year 20XX"", because I know projects like this are likely to have significant delays and specifying a particular month or quarter would likely just lead to disappointment. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/84sptz/mysterium_network_reddit_ama_march_2018/dvur976/ | Can you tell us about your hiring expectations?

Material_Boot6044,"I took my first gap year on purpose by not applying vet school and going to work at a small animal practice. I took my second gap year because I was wait listed, but got in the next year. I'm so grateful for my gap years (planned and unplanned) because they gave me the opportunity to gain clinical experience, great relationships/reference letters, and money. All have been very beneficial during my vet school years and I feel like a learned a lot about myself while not in school. I will be graduating in May and going on to complete an internship then ECC residency. I don't personally understand why gap years are stigmatized and would do everything the same way.|That makes me nervous. I didn't decide to persue an internship until later in my fourth year after all of my externship time was filled. I have reached out to current interns but that has been the extent of my communications with these programs.|3.86 and 35/128"

hawthornehopper,"I did two internships and a residency. I needed years after my training was over to start to feel “normal” again. My physical and mental health were both markedly affected. I have so much more I’d like to say but I’ll finish with - this needs to be published. Please submit it! Maybe JAVMA or even Vet Record just to get it out there!|I would strongly recommend choosing a specialty practice like bluepearl (or I know Medvet has a similar program) so you can get closer experience with not just ER but the specialty services as well. I do not think you need an internship to get proper mentorship and I do agree that, if you have no plans to specialize, these programs seem to make a lot more sense!"

Effective-Clock-7333,"San Francisco, CA here! We added another doctor in October (to make 5 FT) and then were horribly slow through the rest of 2023 and into january. We noticed that the beginning and ends of the week would fill so Wednesday when all doctors were working, we were so slow across the board. So we spread doctor schedules out a bit more and trained our front desk to be more intentional about trying to schedule mid week. We are finally picking up. But honestly, i was speaking with the other doctors and despite being so bored some days, i’ve liked the change of pace to allow me more time per appointment and feel more inclined to really work things up. As has been mentioned in other comments, it has helped me slow down, develop my soft skills, spend more time researching weird labwork results, consult with other doctors, etc. 
For the last two months, all of our average invoices have gone up by $100-150. Because we are working things up and taking more time to explain value of diagnostics or do those sedation procedures in real time. 
One of our doctors is leaving at the end of this month, so I think things will spread out more evenly soon. I also think there was a national slowdown that is now improving. 
Hang in there!|scribenote user here! It has been such a great resource for me and made my records so much more consistent. I’m at a four doc practice and two of us vets use it. I love it!

Hang in there!|salary depends a lot on location and specialty. Small animal ER vets generally make the most of everyone. I’m in the bay area, started making 125k as a new grad doing small animal GP. Yes I have loads of student debt but it’s federal, so payback has been delayed with Covid and now payments can’t be more than 10% of the income i take home, so it will never bleed me dry- it’s obviously just very annoying to be giving away over 1k a month in payments. Honestly, i find it all very manageable. I have no family money, i am not independently wealthy, I worked three part time jobs in undergrad and vet school, still graduated with no savings. Two years out, I feel very financially comfortable. I did not join this field for the money, I did it because i love it, but if i sit and think about my debt, it would make me miserable. I pay my loans, I do fun stuff when i’m not working, all is well. But maybe don’t join the field for the money.|people who have a soul?|omg i am so sorry that happened! you should not be feeling that guilt on top of something so stressful! You are not a fuck up!! You are not a fuck up! You absolutely deserve mentorship and a safe place to learn. Literally what it’s all about. If that on site vet is not comfortable providing that and getting you out of a pinch sometimes, that’s on her and not you. 
Practice is obviously the biggest way to get a feel for tension you need, but also take it SLOW and check yourself over and over. it is not a race!!!! We are typically castrating young and healthy dogs so a couple extra minutes under anesthesia is ok in order to make sure your ties are secure.

I worked three jobs in vet school, one was an overnight on-call tech for the radiology department and I was able to keep that all 4 years. It sucked getting up in the middle of the night, sometimes every few hours, but i was able to do it despite my day time schedule. It also was really great experience. In colorado (where I went), students could also apply for food stamps. Which I did by my second year and that also helped me dramatically in my day to day experience. I can’t say how many hours/week I was working because that was hugely based on my school schedule.

Timely-Run-4601,"Mind if I ask why you haven't already immigrated to a better country? You should be able to get a temporary licence after clearing Navle .|I apologise if the wording of my comment offends your sensibilities.

I did not choose this profession to become a millionaire, I chose it because of my interest in medical science and love for animals.

It is simply a fact that some countries are a better place to live in than others. 

When I said ""better country"" I was simply pointing out that greener pastures exist for veterinarians outside of India(I once again stress that this statement is not intended to belittle india or insult indians.) 

It is an undeniable fact that most developed countries have better labour rights and provide a better work-life balance.|No I'm not saying India is bad .

Thing A being better than thing B does not mean thing B is bad .

It is just a fact that many countries provide a better quality of life than India .|It takes that long ! I thought the temporary licence would be easy to obtain after passing the NAVLE .|Yes , as far as I know, Govt veterinarians are well compensated . 
But I believe new government employees Don't receive a pension and have to invest in the stock market thorugh the NPS scheme(this scheme is also open to the indian public , I believe the US equivalent is called a 401k).
That being said , the present conditions of veterinarians seems to be much better than the past .|Generally speaking tests in India only measure one thing, The ability to memorise truck loads of useless trivia .

The ratio of applicants to job openings is so skewed that it's almost a lottery. 

""My mere frustration with this system lead me to apply to get a vet license outside of this corrupt vicious circle.""

I am certain that this is the only logical choice for those with the means to do so and I further believe that this holds true for most developing countries."

Sociopathic_Elephant,"The good news is you're graduating from high school, so you have an immense amount of time to figure this out. You should look into finding a companion exotics and zoo vet to try and shadow to see what it's like. More good news is that education on proper care is probably 75% of what exotics vets have to do, because a majority of the health problems you see in those animals are due to improper care. 

That being said, zoo and exotics are one of the only specialties where you'll make less than if you had just gone in to dog and cat practice. Probably second only to equine and large animal medicine. And they take a lot of extra work in vet school and beyond to get into, so it truly needs to be your biggest passion. There are other jobs related to the exotic animal field, but frankly they all pay relatively poorly. I know many people that pursued a career to pay the bills and made exotic animals their hobby through volunteering/personal pets/etc."

If you top-up when MYST token is low, you get more tokens. After that you pay your usage with the tokens you have, that's why it's difficult to say in money how much it cost, it's always the same amount of Myst tokens but with a token price variable as other cryptos. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/184fngp/how_much_is_a_gb_or_bandwith_on_mysterium_pay_as/kazhmvk/ | Yes you can pay with card, mysterium will do the change.

In three steps :

First of all check on polygonscan if you can see your tokens, if your Myst balance on polygonscan is zero, of course you can't see it on metamask. 

On metamask add the polygon mainnet network :
https://wiki.polygon.technology/docs/tools/wallets/metamask/config-polygon-on-metamask/

On metamask too, add the MYST token, you need to add it on polygon network :

In my understand you never forwarded ports in your router and it worked before, that's why I'm asking. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/17uzka6/no_traffic_on_my_node/k99ik42/ | First can you look on node UI to advanced setting and ensure that upnp is in first place on NAT config then look on your router if you see any opened port pointing to your node on upnp config ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/17uzka6/no_traffic_on_my_node/k9bus46/ | Hi,

You are right, on dark you pay what you use and can choose the node you use, the 2.0 is on a subscription model and you can only choose the country, not the node.

Here are all the bandwidth-sharing apps I have running simultaneously on a Pi or in Docker. In both formats, I've confirmed they work with Pis. These are referral links, but some will give you bonuses that the regular sign-up does not.

Finally, there's Storj. You will need a large hard drive, like at least 2 terabytes, to make anything substantial, but essentially you're renting your drives and getting paid to help host a decentralized cloud storage service. More info on that here, which should include a Pi setup guide: https://www.storj.io/node ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/11zmvfy/what_other_similarfun_projects_do_you_run/jddebhk/ | Glad to help and thank you too! If I remember right on Honeygain, Pawns and Bitping, I did something special to each that's a little different from their Pi instructions.

-Pawns works on Pi specifically by having Docker installed on it (they have an ARM variant of the container) I'd have to check what I changed on the Docker command, but I made it start detached I think.

-Bitping doesn't need Docker, but since I was doing it on a headless Pi, I installed Screen first, then started a new Screen session via SSH before executing the command to start the Bitping node. This lets you disconnect while it keeps running.

-Honeygain will work on Pis if you run it with an Android image on an SD card. Install Vysor and you can remote access it, allowing you to run headless and still see the Android GUI.

-EarnApp is a one time setup and doesn't need any additional work. It can run simultaneously alongside the others or Docker!

If I had to guess regarding your previous storage node, it might have been Filecoin? That was the similar project I knew about at least.

Also, all of these projects also have Windows, Linux and regular Docker variants if that's more your thing! ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/11zmvfy/what_other_similarfun_projects_do_you_run/jdgbqoc/ | Weird that there might have been another storage project like these two, but you're probably right that it's gone by now.  


I didn't include Filecoin because personally, I haven't tried it myself to confirm whether it's a project where you'll ever see a return like the others. It's definitely a legitimate project, but it has much higher barriers to entry than Storj does for node contributors.

Another one that I forgot was Chia, but it's not a cloud storage project like the other two. This one also requires huge storage drives, but rather than renting them out, Chia uses them as ""plots,"" which I think is their version of mining.

thumbsofgold,"You’ll need a rotating internship regardless. I’m a recent grad applying to internships so I’ve been practicing for almost 6 months in GP. 
The sooner you do an internship the better bc you’ll need recs from professors and you want them to have recent good memories of you. 
While you need decent grades, and research exp for many residencies, who you know and what they think of you is truly the most important thing - so work on wow-ing your professors. You don’t need to be the “smartest” person in the room but you do need to be the hardest working & have a likable personality. My 2 cents.

pixiegurly,"LVT here. 

I think it's really common for techs to be wary, suspicious, and on guard around new grad drs. Enough come into the clinic where the techs have been established, and start with a big ego , disregard our input, and honestly, make mistakes that cause harm. It's absolutely not a reason to be disrespectful tho, but that's definitely how it manifests in some. In which case just demonstrating respect and listening and considering input and *letting us do our part of the job*. 


The other thing is, a TON of techs have a huge chip on their shoulder. Especially, IME, OJT trained ones without a license. I think it's just because of how in general our skills (as are y'all's) are so devalued by society, clients, and also Drs. Plus all the other bs that is in veterinary medicine. When I was new to ER and recently graduated, I had a very skillful experienced OJT tech tell me I wasn't a real tech and my license was just a piece of paper bc I didn't have the same experience. 🙄 And I always valued and respected those with more experience than me. When he said that, I quickly shut it down with no, I have a license I AM a tech, and if he liked he could call me a baby tech bc I'm new and fine with that term. We didn't have a problem after that. I've also seen some say an LVT wasn't an LVT bc they had been outta practice for a while and were rusty on skills. Any excuse to be 'better than.' like crabs in a bucket. It's dumb. 


If directly talking to the tech and asking them hey, what's with you refusing to call me Dr, what can I do to make you feel more comfortable working with me and respecting my title and schooling? (Bc asking like that, in the 'what can I do' way is far less likely to put someone on offense, and may even cause them to consider their role in the relationship.) if that doesn't work, talk to the manager or HR or lead tech or supervisor or lead Dr or whomever about the issue so they can handle it.|LVT here.

teawbooks,"Thank you for laying this out so thoroughly. I left the veterinary profession after completing my internship, entirely due to my experience during that year. I even received a commendation for my performance that year, but I was miserable. I have always felt like a failure that I couldn’t keep going on to residency, but I didn’t think I could manage any more of the system.  My treatment during internship was so appalling, that I now actually feel anxious taking my own animals to a vet clinic. Trying to explain this to other people is impossible. Veterinary medicine is romanticized by most of our culture, to the detriment of the profession. 
Thank you for sharing what needs to change.|Oh wow. I guess we're all in this together?"
BCam4602,"Not a vet but in reception at one where we’re so slow I’ve been dialed back to 25-27 hr/wk vs 33-38. We are expensive and won’t give ballpark pricing of basic procedures like spays/neuters. Most inquiries don’t book when they can’t get an answer. We have space for surgeries next week; when I was hired last June we were at least three weeks out.

Meanwhile, the clinic half a mile down the road that is well known for being inexpensive hasn’t taken new clients in over 7 years and we are getting clients from them because their spays/neuters are booked out until late fall. They are bleeding clients because they can’t keep up with demand with three vets to our one.

We charge $75+ for a feline leukemia vaccine that costs about $12. Is this normal? Our spays/neuters are on the high side. Can a practice’s pricing drive business down like this?|Yesterday we did a follow up exam after a dental referral to a specialist, plus two vaccines. $206.00. The woman about fell over. We saw the cat shortly prior to the referral so should the follow up be full price ($83)? Normally we discount the exam fee when vaccines are given but didn’t on this one for some reason. We are pricing ourselves out of business. 😞|That should be mitigated by explaining the extraneous conditions that could drive the price up. The next statement is “these will be determined upon exam.”  I would say a majority of the prospective clients who call asking for a ballpark and don’t get one end up elsewhere.|I agree with that on the whole but there are extraneous reasons I hesitate to. This is affecting my attitude, though. Since our tech throws out claims that every practice is this way, I just wanted to see how true that was.|Thank you|Well, at this point in time with my hours cut significantly because we are slow, I have noticed that a significant proportion of queries about general cost of spays and neuters fail to book an appointment.

Now there is rumor that the practice is considering adding a tech appointment fee on top of the cost of vaccines. We are charging about $75 for a feline leukemia vaccine as it is. I understand needing to generate income to support the practice but increasing costs in a slow environment seems like a shoot your own foot solution.|Thank you. It’s leaving a bad taste in my mouth. As a pet owner of multiple pets I have always had to be cost conscious but this practice acts as though if they have to ask then we don’t want them. Yet now our hours are dramatically cut because it is so slow. It may be slow everywhere but all the more reason to work harder to attract and keep clients.|Yes, they are usually quite stunned and unhappy|Not a vet but in reception at one where we’re so slow I’ve been dialed back to 25-27 hr/wk vs 33-38.

The owners were super nice and friendly (still Facebook friends!) and would be a great resource to discover other vegan sources of both prepared food and groceries. There are quite a few Rastas on island who tend to be vegetarian or vegan so veganism is not exactly uncommon on St Kitts.

A specific doctor has told me he’ll be the one to show me everything- but he’s also the one that loves to berate me and gets pissed at everything i do (even if i point out a mistake that he made, that’s still something he’ll punish me for) so it is very difficult. I did speak to the head Doctor/owner about him and i’m going to change my shifts so i won’t be on with him once we get more staff (currently hiring)- just need advice until then."

Vacman85,"I am now playing with Monero mining. I went from starting with Mysterium to running a Helium Hotspot, and now I have  Raspberry Pi, a Linux box, and a Windows matching running hashes. Between all three, I have made a total of roughly $10 over the last two week. Lols.

Edit: I’ve made about .003 Myst, and about $8.60 in HNT, and the rest with Monero.

Myst has been running the longest and I’m thinking about abandoning that project. Monero I just started about 36 hours ago - that one seems to have the best chance so far. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/tijvgl/best_ways_to_earn_supplemental_income_aside_from/i1eoy9u/ | I should mention that Monero mining does not use or allow GPU gear. So no need to have expense; impossible to obtain, equipment either. The real trick is to get into a mining pool - where the rewards are shared. Network Chuck (YT) had a great video on how to do this stuff (esp with Monero). The other guy to check out is “Your Friend Andy” on YT. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/tijvgl/best_ways_to_earn_supplemental_income_aside_from/i1ev6n7/ | Time will tell. I think the Helium ride is over - I’ve only been up and running for about two weeks, but I’ve watched the earnings steadily drip lower. Since I have the miner installed, I’ll leave it run until I get my hardware investment back at least. Too early to tell yet, but I’m hopeful on the Monero “farm”. I started running it on a Raspberry Pi 4 B (2 GB) and it barely works. I then did an install on my Linux box and that one is cracking hashes nicely. The Windows machine is doing ok.

ManufacturerFresh914,"Hi! Support staff that uses ezyvet. There’s a lot of good things and a few not so good things about it. 
For instance, upload something in the clinical screen, perfect, amazing, gonna be everywhere. Upload something in the patient or owner screen, it does not transfer. So you need to conscious of that. We have a lot of issues around EOD (we’re 24/7,) where if our pay junction and our Ezyvet clocks are seconds off, it ends up on different reports and triggers a domino effect in our EOD dance. Luckily, Ezyvet is easy to fix errors if it hasn’t been closed out. 
Good stuff: it’s user friendly, everything is mostly color-coded. It’s quick in ER situations and uploads IDEXX stuff automatically. It tells you exactly what’s wrong via small pop up when things won’t/can’t save. It’s got good support. 
Granted, I only have instinct and old school impromed to compare to.  But! I like Ezyvet and it’s been easy to teach."

sweetmissdixie,"I'm so sorry, that's a super frustrating position to be in. I'm on the human side of medicine and have definitely been in your shoes with medical assistants and nurses before. Initially, I didn't say anything because I was worried about coming off as rude. I got walked all over until one of my colleagues, who was much older and more experienced than me, stood up for me when she overheard someone giving me attitude. She then took me aside and told me not to ever let anyone treat me that way. I did end up moving because, like it seems in your situation, it had just gotten bad enough and gone on long enough that there was no fixing it, but moving forward,  at the first sign of attitude, I say, ""I'm not sure what has led you to believe it's ok to speak that way to me, but it isn't. Don't let it happen again."" Regarding the, ""so and so doesn't make me do that,"" I just simply say, ""well, I'm not so and so. Thanks for taking care of that for me."" And then I walk away. Discussion over. It cuts it out pretty quick. Good luck, OP! don't forget all your training and education. Have confidence in yourself. Your job is to take excellent care of patients, not be friends with your coworkers. They don't have to like you but they absolutely do have to treat you (and other colleagues, patients, etc.) with respect and professionalism. Don't tolerate anything less."

I personally think the wellness exam fee is high, but, it tracks for the area. I now work for a private GP, and the vibes are better, as are the prices. And we get paid decently.

The ashes comment from the manager could have been said better, and I would  separate the ashes for the O myself, BUT only with explicit permission from O. Or have the 3rd party do it. 

Also, a lot of the 3rd party peeps have an option for O to make purchases directly from them.

PurrBucket,"On the flip side, I had a human nurse client once  and I was triaging her dog at my previous ER during COVID (curbside) and she said she had spent the whole day giving COVID vaccines and I thanked her for doing that. She said “no, thank you. You all are amazing for doing what you do.” And even when I was asking history and explaining things, I said “I’m sure you understand why we need to do X” and she said “yes, but you’re the experts so tell me anyway”. And it was incredibly refreshing and I’ll never forget her lol|Hello! I hope I can bring some good perspective here. I’m an RVT, going on 20 years in the industry overall. I also have been practicing, performing and teach improv (for performance) almost just as long. Recently I’ve developed an interest in applied improvisation as it relates to communication in a veterinary hospital setting. 

1) in my experience, vet professionals are introverts, for the most part. You always hear folks say they want to work with animals, not people, in the field. I just started at a new hospital and I just ate lunch in a completely silent, yet full, break room. Personally, my experience is with introverts. 

2) vet professionals aren’t performers. The work you’re describing in the class is extremely performative, and having a side-coach like that can be very intimidating. I would cry in that class too, and I have decades of experience with both of these things. Personally, I would not feel safe to be vulnerable in that class. And that’s how you have to be receptive to feedback like that, is being bold and vulnerable to make a choice about your communication, and then you have to be resilient to not take the coaching personally. Not a really useful way to go about it, IMO. Just based on your post, it sounds like a place to cultivate fear and not great communication skills. 

3) do your best not to take it personally. I hope you can find something to take away from the class. But honestly if people are interested in improving communication skills, I would highly recommend improv. Applied Improvisation takes exercises that help performers learn listening, empathy, body language, and resiliency, among other things. It adjusts the purpose of the exercise from
The stage to interpersonal communication. I highly highly recommend it.|My favorite is when owners tell me they know the doctor gave them the wrong product because they “know what it smells like and they didn’t need to do the diagnostics, I could have just told them. This isn’t the right cleaner”"

Adventurous_Pear_711,"I can tell you, as someone who is currently IN vetschool. From experience, it’s not about whether or not you can do it, if you want it and this is interesting to you, you will get it. No doubt. The hard part is knowing that aquatic vet stuff is going to not be a major part of the curriculum. You can find externships and things once you start getting into clinical rotations or maybe even before that if you’re lucky to land yourself in a state school with summers off. The issue that I think most people need to consider about vet med is the very toxic nature of the profession. I’ve posted about this and I’m extremely passionate about changing this because I simply cannot exist in a space where my passion for medicine has been squeezed out of me by the soul crushing behavior of others. Because you will encounter it at some point. You need to be able to decide if you can handle that and if you’re going to join the people who want to change it. I encourage you to find employment at a place you someday want to work as a vet.

It’s unfortunate it’s become this way and honestly I wouldn’t even know where to start. It’s insane to me how people consider this school “reputable” in anyway. It sounds like you have PTSD; how the hell is someone going to pay thousands of dollars for abuse.|Can I ask what department you’re in? 🥹|But like how do you do that? It seems like the person you’d report to would likely just tell you to “suck it up” there’s a major issue here with the “bully’s” having too much power. I’m seriously asking tho|Thank you for sharing your story. I’m really sorry you had this experience. I’m really sad to learn this is considered the actual “norm”. It really impresses on me that we need to be the change. This HAS got to stop.|This especially sucks to hear because those vets all went through this; and you either end up bitter and calloused or in emotional turmoil and extend compassion as a result. Like honestly. You havnt “earned the right” to be an asshole. It speaks more about a person who has been dragged through absolute shit only to remain compassionate and caring of their fellow humans.|None of those schools will say anything about the culture and they generally have “deals” with the schools for being able to place students there, so even if they said they had insight; they don’t. I was told multiple times by a Ross professor before I started that they’ve “been to the school multiple times and they’re good friends with “so and so” and how wonderful things were. When I got here, during my orientation I was asked about Ross; I said “oh you’ll know this professor they come here a lot and is friends with___” I was told “that person was here twice for maybe two days. 🧐 like every step of this whole process is just lies. I don’t understand it. As a whole Purdue will stop at nothing to protect their reputation, not actually do something to benefit the people living in it. It’s hard as a student, everyone is afraid to say something to risk their degree or get some sort of backlash. So the people who CAN say something generally don’t. I will say the clinician that’s the higher up in the ICU/ECC department needs to go. 🖖 and the anesthesia department needs serious evaluation. I’m talking mostly about the techs.|Word around the campfire is they had to pull all the tech students from a certain rotation because they were getting treated so badly. Huge amount of people are quitting now and many departments are super short staffed, but they’re keeping the exact same case load|You would be correct|That’s amazing, it’s so frustrating that vetschool is highly variable as far as what the requirements are with the exact same end goal.|Yes, sorry!|I’m really sorry. There things I wish I would have known before coming here for sure. Ross tends not to be entirely transparent with its students regarding rotations. Welcome to the shit storm.|I’ve heard this a lot.|I get that, but I think that mentality is the problem (no offense here at all) I just think creating a situation where you tell yourself “it is what it is” and “this is normal” just perpetuates everyone’s bad behavior. It shouldn’t be this way, and because it was that way for someone before me, doesn’t mean it should be this way today. Vet med is hard, vets commit suicide. Like in high numbers. You’re career starts here; and this constant abuse even if it’s for a whole freaking year, takes a major toll on mental health. I don’t want to get a mediocre job after graduation thinking it’s amazing because no one is as bad as what I experienced at Purdue.|I never thought I’d say I miss ross, but I miss Ross. For reference.|I’m glad your experience was good overall; thanks for sharing your experience. I will never understand making students work 10+ hours while also having a lot of other extemporaneous objectives, papers, presentations, exams (other academic requirements that need a lot of time devoted outside of those hours) plus being on call and preparing daily for questions! it makes no sense. NO ONE learns well when stressed and exhausted, and certainly no one is capable of giving 100% being pushed to the limits. What’s even the point of that? I get choosing a job that might require those kinds of hours, but after a good education where youre able to rest, and retain things so you can be better prepared for long hours on the job. We need to be learning how to set healthy boundaries. Also, Ross students are forced to track mixed even if you want nothing to do with large animal.

I think my life circumstance has impacted me a great deal. The sacrifices and the hoops are so much greater. I’ve gone back and forth about what I’d do instead and honestly, that only adds to the anxiety of all of this. I’d first need to address the state of my mental health, which is certainly suffering. I don’t have the most helpful or kind husband and he’s the reason for a lot of the time I’ve taken off from school already. To be honest I’m so guilty at the thought of leaving our kids with him 24/7 as he has a short temper and yells at a 3 year old. I worry about their own mental and emotional well being constantly. Granted, finishing this I’d be able to be more independent faster, but the cost of that for nearly a year of them being exposed to that breaks me. It’s triggering as well as my parents were awful to me as a kid, my mom was never around and I’d be left home with the latest abusive dead beat step dad. It’s caused a lot of my issues I have as an adult. Including the anxiety I feel in finishing this at what I feel

johnolerudshelmet,"I'm going to repeat what most other posters have said, but from reading your post, it's the truth.  

This isn't a case of you not being cut out to be a vet. You have fallen into a very bad first job with a very bad first boss, which unfortunately happens a lot in vet med. I promise you, there are good owners and good clinics out there that you should definitely explore before giving up on general practice altogether.  

As far as this nasty boss being intent on burning you out during your 2 month notice, I would recommend 2 things. First, if you have an employment contract, re-read it very carefully. There is likely some language in there regarding a ""reasonable workload"" or something very similar. With all of the stress, anxiety and mental health problems you have accumulated since starting this position, I feel you would have a strong legal case to say your workload is unreasonable for someone of your experience level.  

Secondly, I would definitely chat with an employment lawyer. I noticed you're in Canada in another comment, I know the OVMA provides free initial legal consults, I'm sure other provinces associations have something similar, if not, pay a few hundred dollars to talk to an employment lawyer. This should give you a more finite idea of the actual repercussions of leaving before your notice period is up.  

I'm sorry this has happened to you, but just know this is not a reflection of you, but a reflection on a greedy unempathetic owner."

Also, try to call or email local clinics and ask if there is any openings or even opportunities to shadow. Shadowing can be a starting point to land a paying job once they get to know you more and you showed the passion. Also, volunteering does not have to be full time if you need another job to support yourself, and most clinics don't take volunteers anyway due to liability issues. Volunteering will likely take place in nonprofits or animal shelters, some may have paying positions such as internships or clinic/office assistant jobs. I got my first VA job when I was in college volunteering for an aniaml shelter (later I received an internship offer at the same facility). I emailed the lead veterinarian for a chance to shadow and I got put to work on the spot lol. I understand finance can be hard at times because you just graduated and have no other source of income. But for veterinary experience, sometimes you have to focus on getting the experience rather than making money as the industry itself does not have high profit margin either. Good luck!|I would ask the management for the dress code. I was told to wear scrubs and the boss interviewed me as he was doing a mass removal surgery in the OR.|I work one to two days a week until my clinical rotations. It was minimum wage assistant job, but I was mainly there for fun and experience. It kept my sanity during vet school, because I hate the long and boring lectures, especially on Zoom! I got the chance to play with puppies and kittens, and socialize with my coworkers, also getting paid! I would say do it for the experience, not the money, because you are not likely to be able to cover your living expenses, let alone your tuition, with a part-time job."

I'm doing locum work at the local vet school (Actually quite fun to not have to be full time and I do love teaching) and am working on teleconsultation stuff. But I wish specialty medicine wasn't such a mess. AND it doesn't help that GPs and ERs are in many cases making the same if not more than what we make. My ER veterinarian husband has made more than I have every single year since we have graduated (including internship year) and it definitely makes you realize how much the profession has changed and also the discrepancy between female and male pay.|The vast majority of the time negative accrual isn’t owed if you leave, it just comes away from your production. So honestly, they are trying to steal money from you in your way out and I would be very cautious. Do you mind saying what corp this is?"
BigBeefGuy69,That’s what I would think! But I don’t understand why I haven’t gotten any feedback after the fact. From client or superiors. It’s like I’ve been driving with my eyes closed for 600 miles and just got lucky enough to never hit anyone. And I’m sure there’s things I should be doing differently or could have done differently but if no one tells me about it how do I know?

RosasharnSun,"So I’m a recently SA qualified vet. We had 2 people in our year from North America, both had biological science degrees with honours postgrads but both had to start in 1st year (and I’m sure you’re aware it’s a 6 year course with the first year basically being just non vet sciences). Once you complete your BVSc, to practice in SA you need to complete a compulsory community service year and you only can do it in the year after you graduated. No comserve = no council registration.
You can use the degree to practice in the UK, AUS and NZ without comserve.

OP is definitely a planet of its own. It’s in a very isolated part of town and some people struggle with that, especially in residence. There is a campus psychologist who comes 1 a week but her waiting list was always stacked and it would take months to see her. Pretoria north is functionally 30 minutes from Pretoria main. 

Residence the party/drinking culture is wild but there is space for studying. Academics wise they have changed a lot of things now even since my time - I was part of the last group to endure the block system and to have to have the equines module crammed into 1 semester. It’s definitely tough and a distinction is 75% (in the old days it used to be 65% but honestly the way they test it might as well be!). Admin tends to be on the disorganised side and you often get told of important things the day before (sometimes even the morning of!). And the exam paper setting - my mother is a medical professor and when I told her about some of them she would just gawp in astonishment. It’s not very standardised but hey suppose it makes you think in the fifth dimension

Species wise - expect a lot of ruminant theory  work. Majority of the theory is focused on ruminants throughout the modules. We do have dedicated smallies and equines modules. Wildlife is a very small one semester module in 5th year and exotics is an elective week during clinics. Majority of clinics was smallies rotations as that keeps the hospital ticking over financially.
Clinics are a very vigorous 18 months. The 1 week of ICU night shift rotation is infamous. Like anywhere there are good clinicians and bad clinicians. They do get away quite easily if they aren’t the nicest person to students. But for the most part they do their jobs really well and are good clinicians. 

But yeah doing the NAVLE if you want to go back to America to practice should be definitely on your mind. It’s an expensive test and I think for the SA guys (I was looking into it at a point but decided naaah) was about $10 000. Maybe it will be less if you have American degrees but the majority of the cost was the veterinary testing the and practical exams. 
Hope this helps - you definitely need to make this an informed decision and weigh up the reasons for going to SA. I wouldn’t say the standard of veterinary education would be higher than in the states. Definitely has its own flavour! Our political stability is a bit uncertain with the 2024 elections but that’s always a given. It’s a great country on the whole."

from_the_box,"Hi there, I’m a 3rd year surgery resident! 
Everything Asleep_leopard said here is true. We’ve been through 12+ years of *you must be perfect to move forward* type education. We have never gotten off easy for a missed thing, so we’re type A and seriously anxious about the minute details because the blame always falls to us. And once we’re in practice… what you do is on our license. 

So, what we want from our team is that level of buy-in. We want you to have pride in doing your job right and understanding that whether you do it right can have an impact on patient survival, complications etc. I have so much knowledge to share, but if I have to keep explaining why it’s important and you don’t want to work to improve your own knowledge to improve our care… I will resent it. I need to trust you. If I can’t see you care and or try to improve, then I won’t trust you and will feel like I have to do it myself for safety purposes. And surgeons like doing surgery, we don’t want to do prep and anesthesia and instrument care but if we can’t trust others to do it we will and then get crusty about it. 

In return for your buy-in, I will fiercely advocate for your wellbeing, work-life balance, pay etc. that might be only me because I believe in balance over profit/cutting that one extra case can’t be an everyday thing. But good teams are worth their weight in gold. Not just figuratively but actually in surgery. Efficiency and quality = money, and I can’t cut without a team to do anesthesia and prep etc. Get paid and get out on time. Older surgeons are often not as good at that part. 

Things you can do… read some texts on surgical sterile prep and instrument care. There’s a whole chapter in Tobias (Veterinary Surgery 2nd edition) on instruments and prep and suture and whole texts on it too. Read about procedures - again, textbooks help here but so do pages online from ACVS or other clinics. There’s a book on local anesthesia if you might be learning blocks. And there are tech courses at ACVS conference and through companies to learn more. If you like surgery, negotiate with your job to send you to them. Essentially- if you can predict what we need because you know about the procedure, it will make everything flow better.|Also we are generally really interesting but introvert people. We live hard/work hard. We are normal people underneath the big scary intimidating professional title. Chat up your surgeon while they’re closing! Talk about music playlists, be a human. Ask questions about procedures. BUT if we’re concentrating or things are hairy you gotta be cool with suspending the conversation/us being brusque and short or saying *not right now*. ABC communication in emergencies (accuracy, brevity, clarity). And things can shift in an instant to *this is now very very serious*. And then 10 minutes later we’re like “so how about them Yankees?” Like we never stopped chatting. Don’t take that personally, it’s just part of the job.|Go to ACVS.org and read the residency training standards and requirements. They also have a list of approved/registered programs. You will have to move to one of these places and live there 3 years+ 
Do a paper during vet school or intern year. It will make you a better candidate in match and reduce your stress about qualifying to sit boards.

AmIAmazingorWhat,"Lmao did we get the same offer? Not really, but I just got a VERY similar offer. And I'm in the same boat as you where I really just want to know if it's ""reasonable"" or what to negotiate. In my case, there are a LOT of positives to my position beside the offer itself: desirable location, fantastic practice culture,  great work-life balance. I just want to know if I'm undervaluing myself or not.|Not to steal OP's post... but if the practice offered reimbursement for all the things (license, DEA, CE, etc) as well as an ideal mentoring structure written into the contract, would that make it better/more even? I received a very similar offer and the opportunity itself is fantastic, I just don't have enough experience in the negotiating and hiring process to know what is a good compromise and what to push back on.|It's sad, because I wanted to specialize (in equine internal medicine or advanced radiology) but after seeing what interns and residents go through in my vet school I decided it wasn't worth my sanity. I *love* advanced medicine, and learning, and teaching, and research, and I would have made a damn good resident and internist. 

But I want to see my fucking family, and ride my horse, and sleep more than 4 hours a night, and pay off my $300k student loans.

And so I watch the increasingly desperate ads from vet schools for interns, residents, and clinicians and wonder what they'll do when there's no one left.|I was close friends with some residents and interns in my fourth year, and it physically pained me to see people call them bitchy and complain about them when I had watched those same residents and interns cry in front of me because they were so tired and overworked. Should they be lashing out? In theory, I'd love to say no. But it's pretty hard to be a sunny disposition and not get frustrated when you're running an entire hospital service with only students for help, your attending is MIA, and you haven't slept in 24 hours. 

The trickle down misery is so real|I don't have a lot of suggestions, but I just wanted to say that we as veterinarians really appreciate that someone who isn't involved AT ALL in vet med cares so much about this topic that they looked into it and are interested in helping. 

Perhaps reaching out to the AVMA (the national group that is in charge of oversight of the vet school programs and such) and expressing your concern as a pet owner that veterinarians are experiencing poor working conditions and you want to know what they're doing about it.

One of the problems is that there seems to be no oversight: the AVMA likes to put out pretty words and ""suggestions"" like restrictions on student hours spent in clinics, but there are no consequences for programs that don't follow these restrictions. What this results in is that young vets are ""talking with their actions"" and not doing internships and residencies...which is going to (and has already) lead to shortages in specialties or select for people who don't care about fairness and just keep the same attitude, rather than anything changing. Maybe if the big organizations realized the general public is aware of their dirty laundry and concerned about their transparency and the blind eye they're turning, they would do a little more.|Lmao this reminds me of our communication training. We had ""scenarios"" with paid actors, whom we had to placate and cater to and never ever be honest with despite ridiculous scenarios- one of them was a man with a cat who ate a vegetarian diet because he was vegan and the scenario was that his cat had heart failure and he refused to give it meat/taurine. 

I also was once told that ""I didn't show enough empathy,"" to a client whose fake cat had kidney failure. The way I approached it was to explain what kidney failure was, gave them the options, and then waited for them to process it and remained a calm sounding board and answer their questions. Wtf did they want, for me to cry with the fake client over their fake cat? 

Not once has anything from that stupid class ever helped me, and I always thought the way they coached you to speak sounded extremely condescending, like you were talking to a child.

Edit: FWIW, I have received rave reviews from my bosses about my communication with clients, even clients who have been prickly about seeing ""the new vet"" in the past. So whatever I'm doing is working|I can probably elaborate on what the previous poster is dancing around. What if your mentor isn't doing a good job, and you don't feel like you can go to them (or they're taking advantage of you- giving you cases that aren't good learning opportunities, being unavailable when you need help, etc.) but they're also your boss? How do you approach issues in your learning or place in a clinic when you are worried about your job security because the person you should be able to go to for advice is also the one screwing you over?|Where did you go?!? My experience was similar to OPs although we had more opportunities to get large animal and exotics experience because our clinical schedule was very customizable. But everything else held true. I regularly pulled 80-90 hour work weeks between treatments, on call, weekend treatments, and paperwork.|I didn't go to either, but I've heard good things about both. I've only known one person who went to Davis but she really liked it, I've known a few who either went to or worked with students from NC state and NC state sounds like maybe it coddles them a bit and makes it hard to get the experience needed to be a competent doctor fresh out of school (ie limited opportunities to do things like equine GP work because they don't have that as a rotation, less chances to put in catheters because techs do it most of the time unless you're really self-motivated and insist on doing it).

Definitely don't just take my word for this as most of it is second hand, I went to neither. I think both are likely good schools|We autoligated almost all our cat spays (even pregnant...) when I was doing a shelter med rotation. It made me incredibly anxious at first and I did not enjoy it but I eventually warmed to it. I had several I insisted on throwing ligatures on because I felt the pedicle was fraying too much to be comfortable pulling it enough to autoligate. It is tricky to maneuver the mosquitoes to grab the pedicle in the right spot to ligate, but there were only one or two ovaries (out of like 7 cats) that I genuinely couldn't get it, and the more experienced surgeons did it just fine. I'm not positive but I think we autoligated male dogs as well?

I LOVED autoligating male cats, very efficient, similar to a horse castration (my chosen field).

I just hate surgeries in general and am very happy never spaying a cat or dog again!|The uterus we did with sutures, miller knots. But the ovary was autoligated similar to the testicle, clamping and twisting the pedicle around the mosquitos as close to the ovary as possible, then snipping off the horn/ovary, and doing the little autoligation push. I had a few where the pedicle sheared and tore while I was pushing the pedicle off the mosquitoes (I always noticed it before fully releasing, so no bleeding) and those ones I just kept my mosquitoes in place and slipped a millers knot down over my mosquitoes to tie deeper into the body cavity, and then ""finished"" the autoligation. It always felt more risky than the neuters, it didn't feel like a super secure grip on the pedicle to me. But it worked great in a shelter med setting with limited resources I guess 🤷‍♀️|Huh that's interesting. Yeah it's definitely a bit awkward. I think there's a youtube video about it from the united states humane society that goes over high quality/high volume spay n neuter, but it's been too long so I don't remember what it was called!"

It's just impossible to know what BTS is in 2.0. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/17s4fjx/hiding_vpn/k8nhje1/ | This could be due to the nature of the service, i.e. most if not all providers are real people (we still don't know whether the 2.0 version is actually using real people internet as their providers, since the client is not open sourced yet), so people you're connecting to could just drop their connection for some reasons, as even people on Android can host a node. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/17g5ofe/i_cant_download_1gb_file_through_mystvpn_because/k6hxptm/ | Hi, thanks for the clarification. However, a non-open-source client in VPN space carries no weight. Currently, no one has any idea on how the new client _actually_ works, since there's no proof to be found. Until the source is available, it's pointless to say anything.

Security and privacy should work by design. That's the whole point of decentralization. It won't work because someone's promises. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/17g5ofe/i_cant_download_1gb_file_through_mystvpn_because/k6khkvf/ | I hope the app for 2.0 available on Linux soon!

grmarshall,Really depends how efficient you are with your studying. I work 2-3 short (6-7hr) shifts at the school hospital during my second year and am doing well. The scheduling is super flexible as a student worker which helps. My advice would be to get through your first semester without working and see how you feel!

TerribleDrawer3730,"I’m also in western Canada (BC) and looking to make a switch to vet med. what did you find starting salaries are in the area for small animal? Is production a thing in Canada? Do you know what large or mixed practice salary looks like? I can’t find this info hardly anywhere!|I’m also confused. I was planning to apply and go into vet school back in 2014 and decided against it because the pay would have been very similar to what I ended up doing now ($80-100k average salary) and I didn’t think some of the trade offs were worth it. Now I’m sitting here 10 years later at the peak of my career with little salary growth left and vets are making 2x what they were 10 years ago. I’ve applied to go to the MD route recently but considering applying for DVM after seeing some of the threads on salary and working 3-4 days a week! $100k does seem low for the time and money invested for vet school, but $150-$250k does not."

Unhappy_Passenger_86,"As some one who is also coming from a difficult situation and trying to pursue vet school, I have the greatest amount of empathy for you and your situation. I had my son my sophomore year of college and being practically homeless made it really difficult. I worked full time, took care of my son and just tried to barely survive. My end GPA at my undergrad school was 2.89. so I completely understand that low grades can be hard to come back from. 
I share this because I have gone on to get waitlisted at a vet school and this year I have again gotten interviews and a chance to go. Look at each vet school before you write yourself off and see what their requirements are and how they calculate GPA. I put mine into a Google doc so it was easy to read. I then looked VERY critically at my own academic experience and matched all the classes I had taken and their grades with the prereqs of each school.  A lot of schools (not all) out more weight on last 45 (semester credits, 60 quarter credits) than on overall GPA. If you can show in your last 45-60 credits that you were able to turn your grades around, it makes a really compelling case for you GPA wise. As for the DUI, I would be honest but not overly ""woah is me"" when it comes to discussing it.  They are not robots and the admissions people are generally awesome to talk to. So go into it with a growth mindset. ""I messed up, but here is what I learned and how I am taking steps in the future to keep it from happening again."" 
Diverse experiences and lots of hours will also help your case. If you look at your experience and see you don't have large animal or research, try to find ways to really get as much variety and length of hours as you can. I work in the research field, so my hours there number over 10k, but I had never worked in private practice, so I called every vet practice I could reasonably get to and found one that let me shadow. If you love wildlife, get involved at a wildlife rehab place and show that you really do want to be in that field, or become a zoo volunteer. Your past is only a fraction of who you are. Spend the vet school application showing them who you are now, and take steps to prove you have what it takes. Best of luck to you in your current and future endeavors! It's a hard road, but you are never without hope."

( boss just has high standards)  do you have any education? reception or assistant or kennel staff is an option.|which muppets would you eat first and why|you would need to be trained as an LVT to administer and monitor anesthesia as well as dental radiology in a variety of species ( whereas  you only deal with 1 species lol) - animal teeth are much different than humans and get different diseases.  also,  this just doesn't happen. occasionally vets work with dentist for root canals or specialty stuff but LVT's are trained and can specialize in animal dentistry.|when people tell you stuff- take notes.  

be quiet, listen and ask a lot of questions- and take notes.

 don't wear perfume and be quiet with cats and dogs . and FFS do not lean down into dogs  faces- just give animals space and don't be all into their faces. I can't tell you how many new people get bit in the face for being idiots. animals are scared at the vet, even if you can't tell and can bit without warning. you won't be able to truly get animal body language for years, so until then just keep your hands to yourself

watch Jackson Galaxy  and Sofia Yin videos on YouTube

muzzle any dog you are not comfortable with no matter what anyone says. I worked for 18 years and was never bit. I would get giant pit bulls we never saw before I muzzled them because  it doesn't hurt their feelings and I felt better ( we saw a lot of pitfalls because we ear crop- not my choice but whatever)

learn Fear Free and Cat Friendly practices- this will take you a year or two but you'll be a better human if you take those to heart.

lastly use food and treats to distract. if your clinic uses them- embrace them, if they don't come back and ask about it

don't expect everyone to welcome you with open arms. its a very stressful job and a new person is time consuming/ and draining to train, even worse when they know nothing. yes they want you there but it could take up to a year to prove that you're trustworthy. I spent many years training just for people to quit after a month because they didn't understand what vet med actually was.|In Michigan you can start at 18+ an hour. Do you speak Spanish?

Seriy tho, mainland USA of good pay and even signing bonuses, much better than there|a bilingual vet tech can probably yield more|I left 5 years ago at $21.5 per hour, and since everyone got a big raise . there is a shortage of LVT's and finally getting paid better to attract them.|most girls have roommates or husbands. rent here is based on 2 income households unfortunately|at my clinic we only with 4 years degree's for receptionist and assistants, unless they are enrolled in school. ( boss just has high standards)  do you have any education? reception or assistant or kennel staff is an option.|which muppets would you eat first and why|As a long time vet tech I support this because :

1. We can all learn from each other
2. New grads can be terrible/awkward/wrong in exam rooms
3. Also the support staff details be monitored, these are people you are trusting to do the right thing with the clients

I suggest embrace it.

We have 1 vet ( 8 doctor practice) who was awesome at explaining and had the analogies and I wish the doctors could observe that 

And we have another vet  who sucks at exams, misses things and don't exam everything. And there's nothing we can do, even when the client calls and asked about something they missed.  It's frustrating."

llotuseater,"I'm a veterinary nurse. I have about 20 tattoos over my arms including paw prints of pets and portraits of pets. Most of my co-workers similarly have lots of tattoos over visible parts of their body. I have coloured hair and am not the only one who has facial piercings. My practice owners joke it's almost a requirement to work there to have tattoos and coloured hair. 

I've only encountered one very conservative clinic who told me they wouldn't hire me over my blue hair and told me to change it if I ever wanted a job anywhere. Not somewhere I would want to work and I knew that was straight up lies. I had previously worked with people with tattoos and piercings and coloured hair. 

It's getting better, but conservative practises still exist. Get the tattoo!

Annatolia,"I've been a tech for 13 years and worked with plenty of new grads. Worked with some great ones and some crappy ones but I still never called them anything but Dr. [Lastname], or just [Lastname] if we were chill and working together a lot. The technician you are working with is being disrespectful to you for whatever reason, I'd suggest attempting an open conversation first and then setting some professional boundaries if that goes poorly or her behavior is unchanged. Some techs are impatient with new graduates or playing a toxic game that you certainly have no need to take part in."

The confidence and growing I did while working at a clinic was incredible and beyond worth it. I wish every pet owner had to be an assistant for a day and appreciate it 😂|It is!! Also I have found that most people who are willing to take their pets to the vet at least care! You are entirely right, most of my friends actually became nurses and ones a doctor and they suffer from the same type of compassion exhaustion. It really is just a difficult field, not just in terms of studies. I don’t think anyone knows if they can handle it until they do.|Hello, ex Guelph student that had a clear shot into Dvm program and didn’t even end up applying. I originally wanted to be a vet to help animals, kinda not the biggest fan of people but will work with animals happily. Got a job for the experience and worked there for my whole undergrad. Could not wait to quit. By the end, I really couldn’t stand vet med. was just looking for a job where people aren’t exploited and everything is about the love of animals- it’s not. I went home daily depressed over how many bad owners there are or that people are paying crazy amounts for medications for their pet. The pharma industry along with terrible people ruined the industry for me. It’s super hard work, and while it’s rewarding if you like being mentally stimulated all the time, but it’s not rewarding to your pockets. Vets aren’t rich, school is very expensive, and none of the vet staff are paid fairly for the work they do. It’s really an industry of people who love animals but need to deal with a whole lot of roadblocks to show that love. One client that never left my head was a lady with a kitten with a life threatening disease, not incurable but not 100% effective and very expensive. Screw you pharma patent holders!! She didn’t have the money, called every single day to tell us her kitten was dying and it’s our fault for not helping her and we are kitten murderers. She had options- pet care loan with no interest, give kitten up to someone who can take care of it, family/friends, anything? Because nothing was not an option, unfortunately it was the one she made. Pets are belongings by law, so nothing we could do. If we paid out of pocket for every person who came in unable to afford care then there would be no business or pet care. People who can’t afford their pets need to stop! I remember a client wanting us to put her 6 year old dog healthy sweet dog down because they were expecting a baby and couldn’t find them a new home. Tired of hearing people lose their cats outside when that’s not even legal in Ontario and die so stupid fast to car, coyote or kidnapping. And are invasive species?? I never cared for the money, but this career had one hell of an impact on my mental health. Please work at a clinic during school while doing another degree you also have interest in would be my biggest advice. I got my job really easily by expressing my interest in animal care studies- hand your resume in in person. Even though it wasn’t for me, if you have thick skin and can handle seeing and not being able to do anything then go for it. You do end up helping a lot of animals and people :)|I wanted to add that there isn’t a vet I’ve met that regrets it. You’ll bail before you get there if this isn’t for you.

These are very good questions.Try posting it not under the questions for veterinary school. Also I wish I had the chance to study animal science in school. Good luck with everything."
Asleep_Leopard182,"I can't help with the first bit - as I'm sure there are plenty of others more qualified than myself to provide better advice here.  


However, with the second half around surgeons.  
My best advice here is to come from their position & understanding, and meet that in your advance and behaviour. Being surgeons - they've gone through (likely) a Bachelors, then a 4 year Doctorate, then a 1+ year internship, a 4 year residency, and then spent X number of years in a specialisation. When you have that much education under your belt, sometimes things can seem obvious, or are natural to you (from practice and/or also being held to certain standards), that are not obvious or natural to others, particularly vet nurses, and hospital orderlies (which where I am, can exist from zero formal education, through to bachelors in general surgery), which even at the highest form of training, is about 9 years of education & specificity below that of the surgeon.  


Knowing basic things, being able to predict what comes next, being able to notice the small things, and being consistent & solid in your approach. If they ask for tape - ensuring the tape is the correct length for whatever they're planning to do. Know procedures, so when they ask for suture, you don't have to ask which one (unless it's weird, and alternative & needs a double check - in which case make it clear it's double checking).   


In my experience working with surgeons, it's less so that they're directly aggressive, but it is that they want quality work, to meet the standards they have set not only for you, but for themselves. When they are trying to do complex things, they don't want to have to be worrying about how or who is holding an animal.  


That doesn't excuse the relatively common behaviour of being a stick of dynamite behind the scenes (in which case, I just say move practices - it's not your job to fix them), particularly to those in training - however, ensuring that you are thorough and thoughtful in and about your job should show through. Keep in mind they've probably stood where you're standing at some point, quite a few vets started as vet nurses (and have hours in the job), and it can get very frustrating very quickly if you have to think for two, instead of one (particularly on the basics), particularly if it is the basics they're working on.|Full disclosure, am vet student, not vet nurse - but these are the areas that I regularly poke and see what falls out.

\- Depending on where you got your certification, you can often access library memberships as an alumnus. They will have a wealth of stuff that you can use.

\- Googling vet tech CPD and/or continuing education should yield more results than I can provide- Instagram, I follow a few vet techs & vets on there that post interesting cases (doesn't qualify for CPD, but it helps me expand knowledge).

\- If you are registered, your registrar should also have access to databases with your membership. If you have a topic of interest - throw it into google scholar, see what comes up.

\- Doing smaller side-courses, if you're not already a registered RVT, then doing that as an upskill, or even going on to do further vocational training in specialised areas can be relatively short in duration, but very good for further understanding. 

\- If you don't see yourself returning to practice any time soon, looking at Bachelors in the area 

\- Science, Animal Science, Nutrition, Biology, Biochemistry, Animal Behaviour, and so forth can really open up and broaden understanding. Quite a few uni's actually release their courses (without the certification at the end) to the public, which you may find useful to go through.

\- There are also plenty of areas that are available for free - Osmosis (through data bases), Youtube - Khan Academy, Ninja Nerd, Crash Course. Outside of this - Anki, textbooks, and just sourcing general stuff. Ninja Nerd actually goes nearly to the full depth of my degree itself when it comes to bio knowledge. It can't teach you to vet, but it can teach you the underlying bioscience to a well and truly solid level. We do go a little further (dysfunction, changes in dysfunction and so forth, before heading to diagnostics & treatment), but it will give you the in-health level.

E: Someone else also mentioned VIN - which absolutely as well. They provide free access if you're in a related course of study too, which depending on where you are in the world, can include online self-paced courses. Just a tid bit.|I double this

There will also be emails and other methods of communication with the advisory team that don’t require in-person contact.

We just went through an accreditation, and as well as having student boards, open hours, and walk-through, there were other methods of anonymous (which you could double up by using a second/throwaway email and so forth) communication.|There is definitely a place for you in vet med. However, only you can make the decision of whether or not you are happy to take up that place. There are plenty of more direct, less enduring careers that may make you as happy - and it's ok to ask if vet is worth it.  


Without even getting into specifics - vet med is short of everything, everywhere at the moment. Every vet student counts in building back up numbers, and restoring staffing shortages. The numbers shortage is so critical that even areas such as governmental departments are facing shortages - let alone more complex/demanding fields such as research or pathology.  
Vet school also does tend to have a narrow field of view too in my experience, where people are boxed into ""largies"" and ""smallies"". Half the people who answer are just answering for the sake of it. Others are genuine in their interest. Good chance a 2/3 also have no idea what is available outside those answers. It can often make it seem pretty naive, or simple - leaving you questioning if you're overthinking things. You're not - you've just got a different perspective you can bring to the table.  


I would also reassess whether or not you are burnt out - vet school is not easy, it's not well balanced and you're often left questioning things, even if you can't see an issue. It's partially the nature of it. It's such a demanding degree, that has such a high requirement of people in order to complete.   


I also want to mention the general toxicity that is veterinary hospitals - and for some reason, university hospitals. So many are just straight up horrible places to be. So much so if you scroll down on here it's a regular post from people actively doing placements from within them. It seems to be a shared item too, even from people who haven't actively posted. Every vet seems to have a story about someone who would just casually lose their temper (or be a narcissistic egotistical asshole), within a hospital placement. I can't answer to why, but residents are often the bottom of the trough to begin with relating to work (unfortunately), I'm willing to bet they're feeling it and passing it onto the students.|What stage of education are you at?Can you look elsewhere? What are your chances of getting into vet school in reality? (have you completed dip/bach/mast, research, other hours? other experience? local vet schools?)

It might sound backwards, but I worked hospitality up and am still in it whilst in Vet school.Use your hours and your time wisely. A higher wage opens up hours if you stay on the same total yearly income. It opens up time - which you can then use to diversify. Increased diversity also allows opening up opportunities outside of s/n.

Spay & neuter is good, I won't lie, but you need more than that to get into vet school, and you need more than that to eventually do it well. It's OK to do 37-40h a week, but diversify.

Being that you do 37-40h, I'm assuming you're not in continuing education too? Which again, can be another consideration on things. Vet schools will not look badly IF you have a continuing education with a non-industry related job.  


E: I Just want to add too, S/N tend to be community programs, so do tend to be low paid, low diversity, low growth jobs - these are good entry level positions, but if you want to get into vet school looking beyond this is necessary to an extent. They want well rounded candidates that are aware of the stresses & effort the field demands - this is part of the reason behind things like hours, research, and so forth. They want candidates that are already actively participating, and are not only educated but aware of the efforts it requires. Yes, S/N is good as it's high volume work - good hours, good surgical exposure, but it's only one area of a multifaceted profession.|A couple of things to consider  


\- As WeaselWarrior said, if you're fine with the aspects of problems & people - then you're probably fine. However, it is a large financial burden to take on. It's worth looking internationally at what is available, and where you would like to be. I also would look to where you're at, and look at how much you're involved with the medicine side of things, and see where you feel you stand with that - veterinary is literally medical, and one thing that I wasn't exposed to as much as other areas was how medical it would be (I don't have a problem with that & is one of those areas that I love - but it can shock people & be one of the main reasons of dropping out for those who don't get that experience prior).  


If you can, get experience (even just shadowing) in a clinic, and get a really good look at the life. Really go for it, and see. However, at the end of the day completing a DVM is different living in the profession.  
The other thing I thought through when I looked at doing my degree (internationally accredited DVM) was, if I were to leave the profession where would my DVM get me, versus other avenues. With my DVM, I can move laterally into research, I can take on governmental jobs, move internationally, continue through to residencies & specialisation, I can move into advisory roles and so forth. I could also move into areas that would be classically covered by a JD/business degree too (I'm Aussie - so it's a bit easier here). I can't do that with a PhD in some niche, or a second bachelors. Is it perhaps what I want? Not necessarily right now, but as an option for a parachute, you can't deny it's style with versatility.  


There's also nothing saying you can't do coding on the side - the biggest difference between my life pre-DVM and now is that my side hustles and hobbies were TO get into the DVM. I was also doing stupid hours on stupid hours volunteering, finding anything to get experience for the DVM. Now I'm there - I have time to do other things (sometimes!!), such as learning to invest on the stock market, and am now playing with shorts on sim. Once you're a vet, you may have time to do other things. There is a hustle culture in veterinary so this may get backlash - but at the end of the day, as a vet - you don't need to do that internship/specialisation, you don't necessarily need to constantly look at other things, you can walk away at the end of your shift and do something else. The time that is now spent non-degree working, that's ""free time"" once you're a vet. You can do something else there. Add in some of the recent improvements in compensation and if you were willing to stay in your current lifestyle, you could probably do a degree on the side (if you can get into a DVM, you can do another bach).  


It could be worth chatting with a uni careers advisor, or a counsellor too - to get an impartial opinion. Not family, not friends, not other vets (all a mixed bag, but none unbiased).|If you like shadowing, then you should be pretty right for the job itself. Particularly if there's few limitations to what you currently do/see/participate in.  


The one thing I would absolutely stress, to both yourself and anyone reading this - is even when in vet med, don't give up your hobbies. Yes, it demands so much but I think one of the biggest problems at the moment in the industry is people forget it is a job - not a lifestyle. I'm only a vet student, but we are constantly drilled to have other hobbies & passions, and life outside the course. It's easy to slip up and turn 100% med, but to have that option & outlet is crucial as it makes a huge difference to QOL. I also know I'm not alone in this opinion, and not alone in sectioning off time to work on hobbies & external interests.  
One of the areas vet med lacks too is proper IT and streamlining programs, so who knows - you may be able to use those skills more readily than what you think.  


Definitely chat with as many people as you can, particularly those ""knowing"" the industry, but not fully in it. Get as many opinions, then sort through them. You don't have to listen to them, but use them as thought & planning seeds.  


I can't answer for US college fees - again I'm Aussie - and I was lucky enough to do both my degrees CSP, with a bursary from one uni, and a couple of other things thrown in (and with a steady well paying job in hospo that compliments hours that I've worked up to senior positions), but all I can say is do the math, look at everything that is available, and see where to go. Not so much ""do your own research"" but do the footwork, make contacts, and research inside and out then get advice from that. I'm not the first person in my family to get tertiary study, but I am the first to go to this extent with Bachelors/doctorates/masters, etc. - and having supports makes a huge amount of difference, even if they aren't necessarily family/friends.  
I don't know the average cost of a degree in the US, nor what else is available to you, but I also would stress to look at scholarships and what it would take to get things such as partial or majority $$ paid for (including international). I would also crunch average salaries, and see how much financially it would take - and if it would be worth it. I would however stress not to auto-fall back on coding, as at the moment they can be hit & miss with workforce supply, and it's as much connections due to being a relatively limited industry (every industry has it's warts).  
It could be worth making connections in subs & in person at uni's you're looking at targeting too, even heading in and seeing what people suggest in regards to scholarships and such.

rawdaddykrawdaddy,"I moved out there to be a technician in 2017 and cried almost everyday for six months before I quit.

I didn't know how to help him, and I felt that every word I said was something he really listened to which actually really stressed me out because I still feel like a baby tech so felt that I shouldn't be someone he listened to. As dumb as that all sounds, it made me really stressed to work with him. My unicorn practice noticed I was stressed before I did (I'm terrible at deciphering my own feelings) and talked to me about it in a private environment. They switched me off being his tech and gave him a tech that is extremely experienced and was able to help him in all the ways I couldn't. 

That all being said, I never made any rude comments to the baby vet like those girls did to OP. No matter how stressed I got. That is classic mean girl behavior and should never be tolerated.|We've started losing crazy things at my hospital recently. A fetal two headed pig recently went missing.

bewseyD,"As a person who has been through graduate entry myself, I STRONGLY recommend that you consider applying to Cambridge. You can apply directly to a postgraduate college (I went to St Edmund’s), and they love people with interesting backgrounds and a breadth of learning and experience. They also look very favourably on “second chance” applicants - we had mature students in my year who had a real variety of backgrounds, ranging from people like me with an arts background (previous degree in English and Philosophy) to my friend Paul who had a past criminal record but had turned his life around. She sounds like the sort of candidate they would love. 
One word of caution, however - they assume everyone applying there has an excellent academic background and great references; those will not make her stand out. Cambridge places enormous importance on the interview - it will come down to how well she comes across on the day and how well she can tell her story."

Yes, and I think you set your boundaries in the wrong place.  You say you're trying to learn and improve, but you twice told him that you weren't willing to put in any personal time to learn and improve.   He has a right not to expect you to work on your days off, but he was asking to come with him to learn on a day off, and I understand why he sees your unwillingness to do that as frustrating.   He's reasonably expecting you to continue learning when you're off the clock - especially being as new in the profession as you are - so I think you're shooting yourself in the foot.   You are right that you don't have to do it on your day off, but don't expect him to be excited about your lack of motivation and interest in improving.  

If you'd been out 5 or 6 years and he made the same request, I'd have a different answer, but at 1 month post graduation you should be doing a lot of learning and improving both at work and when you're not at work.  

This is not the same as protecting your days off from having to do work for them, and he's not making any money off of the time he's asking you to donate.|>It’s not reasonable to expect a new grad to only be learning on their days off. 

I agree - it's also not reasonable to expect a new grad to only be learning when they're on the job.   Or, to put it another way, I wouldn't want to hire a new grad who only wanted to learn when they were being paid.   New grads are entitled to refuse to take learning opportunities when they're not on the clock, and owners are entitled to not find that very appealing or impressive.

That's pretty easy if you are travelling within the US, but it's much more difficult (probably unrealistic) if you wanted to travel to other countries.  Vets are licensed by the state, which is why many relief vets will stay where their current license allows them to work - but that's a choice you might do differently.  

I'm Canadian and only have a license for one province, because licenses here are pretty expensive (over $1000/yr), so I would need a significant amount of work (or a personal reason to go) in different provinces to make that worthwhile.......In the US, different state licenses are much more affordable, which would make it a more realistic option for a relief vet to be licensed in several (many?) states.  Of course, there will be other requirements for licensure in different states (maybe a local test or police screening), but you can decide if those things are worth it to you to travel to different states to work.  

I don't recommend relief work until you've been working as a vet for at least 3-5 years, though, but I do recommend it for vets who are of the right personality and skill level.

> and the contents of an injection I was giving leaked out through the other end of the dog's skin.

I've been out almost 25 years, and it still sometimes happens to me.  Another thing that sometimes happens in long, shaggy-coated dogs is that I give an ""inter-fur"" vaccine and not under the skin at all.  Stuff happens - it's how you manage it that counts.  Did you see what happen and apologize that you needed to give another (or another partial) injection?  Acknowledging it to the clients helps them see that you're human and make mistakes, and can rectify them.  It won't work for all clients, but it helps minimize the issue.  

>The client said no to everything I offered but still complained that I hadn't done anything at all. 

Yeah, that will happen, unfortunately, which is why your records are very important - including what you recommended and what they declined.  I had a client complain to the clinic owner that all I'd done when she'd been in with her cat for urinating outside the litterbox was tell her that her cat was ""fat"".  Dr. Owner opened my record and saw a full page of notes regarding everything I'd discussed behaviourally and physically, with one line that say ""unable to palpate urinary bladder d/t obese"" so no cysto.""  (ultrasounds were uncommon back then.)

>told me to ""recommend"" instead of ""offering"" 

I have 3 levels of urgency when discussing testing for a pet:  ""I want to do this"" if the patient is at risk of a significant problem or disease, ""I recommend we do this"", if I think something will help us work up a minor problem, ""I can do this, if you want"" for something I think is unnecessary at this point in time, but might make an anxious owner feel better (eg FNA on a first exam mass that looks and feels like a lipoma).  

Ultimately, you will have to find the language that works well for you and communicates how you feel about it - and you don't have to use the same terms with every client or every situation.  I was taught to say ""need"" instead of recommend, but I could never get it to sound natural coming out of my mouth - I always felt I was lying.  So I found what worked for me but still served the patients, clients, and clinic owner well.

I put ""full time"" in quotes because doing relief was my only job, but I didn't work a full time schedule and some times of the year I was busier than other times.  I was solo, in that I didn't join an employment agency for relief work.

I don't think that being out for only a year is really long enough to have the experience necessary to truly be comfortable working alone (and in 95% of the time I was the only vet) because so much else is also new every week or every day - new staff, new facilities, new drugs on the shelf, new vaccine protocols, etc.   But, I also know everyone is different, including our experiences before we became vets.  

I think the first things you need to do is decide geographically where you're going to look for work (how far are you willing to travel?), and find out what you need to set up what kind of business entity (I'm in Canada, so if you're in the US, I can't recommend anything).   Then start spreading the news in that general area that you're offering relief services.   Set up at least an informational website (I don't recommend taking bookings via your website), and send out some emails.  

Here's the most important thing:  Set up some boundaries for your work, and start thinking about them now.  The more boundaries you have, the fewer number of possible clinics you can work, so don't go overboard on your list, but decide what you're willing to do and not do, and what lines you won't cross.  Is it about vaccine protocols (will you work for a clinic that vaccinates for everything yearly)?  Is it about declaw or tail docking surgeries?  Shelter work (some clinics do surgeries and euthanasias for local shelters)?   Will you work with back to back 15 minute appointments?  Etc......

Those are things you can and should discuss with the clinic owner or manager before you take the job, because once you're there you have a responsibility not to turn away a bunch of business because Dr. Owner does things that you don't like (or can't) do.  I personally recommend you go to visit every clinic before you decide to accept work there - not only does it show general interest and involvement, you might find things that might influence your decision to work there or not (such as whether all the equipment is operational, or whether there's a hole in the ceiling that often allows dust to rain down into the room below).|What kind of unit do you have?

Good - what the clinic is doing isn't wrong, but it's not what you're comfortable with, and that's OK.

They can suggest a vet what to use, but they can't tell a vet what they should do medically - that would be practising medicine without a license.  

A practise manager can ask a vet to use a certain drug (""we have this in stock, can you use it instead of X?"") or can refuse to make a certain drug available in the clinic (""we can't stock X because it's too expensive and isn't used often enough""), but that's not telling the vet what to do.|OK, it sounds like the PM might not have told the vet what they must use, but instead made a suggestion that they thought the vet should consider.   What language and tone the PM used is important here - if the PM said something like ""you should use this - Dr. Y had a similar case and it worked out well"", then it's a suggestion, and that's very different than ""that drug won't work, you should use this one instead"" which is directing the vet's treatment.

Did the vet think about it and use it instead because the vet thought the suggestion made sense, or did the vet use it instead because they felt they had to or they would face anger or discipline?  You probably don't know, but those are the things that determine if the PM was trying to practise medicine, or trying to make a helpful suggestion.|Then that was wrong - but it's on the vet as much - if not moreso - than the PM.|There's an AviMark help Facebook group - I've gotten some help from them before.|Have you heard of VetLife?

Then there are some species, and some animals with physical limits, that require some ""creative"" techniques and positions.   There's also the problem of getting animals to be still while imaging - particularly in patients that you don't want to, or can't, sedate, and that leads to a fair bit of manual restraint in small animal radiography and ultrasonography.  

Animals are obviously sedated for MRIs and CT scans, but that can be counter-productive for fluoroscopy - but these three techniques are more limited to specialty practices than to general practitioner vets.|My friend does house calls for geriatric and palliative care.

For the vast, vast majority of vets (those working in clinical medicine), this is a medical degree - we are doctors, but our patients happen to be animals rather than people.  Medical doctors don't go to med school and become doctors because they have a ""love and passion for people"".   In my opinion, a clinical vet needs a curiosity and interest in medicine/surgery primarily, and (in small animal medicine) a respect for and desire to support the human-animal bond between owners and pets.|A love of animals had nothing to do with it -- I was interested in medicine, and didn't want to be an MD.|Often at least 2 internships (i.e. 2 years) are required, because it's pretty competitive.....that might not be the case when the OP is graduating.|I haven't done it, but I suspect the change of pace and money would be a tough road (faster pace, less money).

Not ""what do I do"", but ""help me learn X"".   Don't be afraid to excuse yourself from the exam room for a moment....When I graduated, a classmate said she never took a pen into the room with her so she'd have an excuse to leave and grab a minute or two to look something up, ask a question, or just think  while away from the clients' eyes.

But please know what ""mentorship"" means to you, because it doesn't mean the same thing to everyone.  If you want a ""mentee"" relationship with someone make sure you and they have the same expectations of what that means.

Personally, I think it's better to have a mentor that does not work where you do, especially not your boss - there's a real power dynamic there that can impede a good mentoring situation.|>and never felt the need for a power dynamic.

You misunderstand me if you think I said it's something you need.......Actually, it's something that exists, whether you want it or not, and I think it's something that isn't anything anyone wants in a mentoring situation.  

A vet can't escape that power dynamic in a mentoring situation within a clinic, but sometimes it's not healthy or not the best situation to mentor someone.  What if a mentee wants to deal with a medical situation in a way that is different from their boss, and doesn't know how to approach that situation?  What if one of the professional challenges they face is how to deal with a client who is also the boss' neighbour?  What if a mentee wants to discuss how to face the challenges of contract negotiation, or how to think about the future of their career and other job prospects?  What if they're worried about an ethical situation that they're not ready for their boss to know about?

Mentoring isn't training, and it isn't limited to delivering medical and surgical care.  There's no reason a mentor has to be in the same facility, because the real issues that need to be discussed aren't things that need to be discussed right then.  Training someone how to improve their speed in surgery isn't mentoring, and it's not mentoring to teach someone how to deal with a ruptured anal gland for the first time - mentoring is the big picture issue of discussing and encouraging someone how to solve those problems themselves|Are you a vet?

Yup - there's a surplus of vets out there now.  Your area might be in dire need of vets, but that's not because there aren't vets looking for jobs, it's because most vets are looking for jobs in suburban and urban areas (for various reasons).  Adding more vets won't suddenly make more people want to live in different parts of the country, or live different lifestyles.  

I agree that there's a problem of distribution of vets, not a problem in the number of vets.|>As someone who lives rural you absolutely can just not respond after hours. None of the vets here do.

That depends on where you practice -- in some places, vets have an obligation to respond after hours and they can be sanctioned if they don't.|>For example the dakotas, nevada, new mexico, wyoming, etc. dont have vet schools so the only people moving to those states to be vets are people who left them for vet school originally.

Don't for a second think you'll be avoiding ""crazy clients"", because you'd be exchanging them for ""crazy clients in grief"".  Don't do it because you think you'll be avoiding stress or needing to learn a bunch of stuff, because there's no such thing as a ""routine"" euthanasia any more than there is a ""routine"" ear infection or ""routine"" surgery.   It will create possibly more stress, not less stress, because it's every owner's worst day, and you have to be a bit of a counsellor as well as a vet.

What you're describing is based on your personal experience at one vet school in one specific time frame -- but you're advising other people (who may or may not be like you) about what their experience will be like at one of over 3 dozen vet schools at some unknown point in the future.  I say that as a vet who will happily tell anyone who asks that vet school sucked, but it was what I had to do in order to become a vet, and being a vet is way better than being a vet student.  

I didn't deal with a toxic environment, though I did deal with a few instructors who were a-holes.  That happens in any school or workplace.  That's especially true in an environment where sometimes there are literally lives on the line, and the instructors have to be sure they can fix whatever problems the students create.

Perfectionism is the bane and lifeblood of veterinary medicine, and I think it afflicts students more than it does the instructors (who know how to deal with errors and imperfection).  Perfectionism among vet students, and then vets, is an unfortunate byproduct of the selection system (IMO), and is the source of a lot of the mental health problems in the profession (IMO).

Of course there's no support for all species groups -- do you have any idea how many species that would be?  You're upset because you didn't get instruction on the unique and limited species you wanted to learn about, but that disappointment is on you:  You should have - and could have - know about that before you went to vet school.  All you would have had to do was peruse the courses and ask a few questions on forums like this (or StudentDoctorNetwork) to know that ""niche"" species and areas of interest are really not covered in undergrad vet school.  It takes post grad and extra curricular classes to get to those parts of veterinary medicine.  

That ""you're not a real doctor"" situation you're facing sucks, but it's a reality of the profession and something you definitely could have known about because it's not new.  It's been that way for 50 years, and happens even to specialists.   You've obviously spent time shadowing or working with vets, and you've obviously spent at least a decade being around people and seeing/hearing how they think about vets - didn't you ever see that before?   Anyone who becomes a vet expecting prestige or money has made a mistake, and it's unfortunate that anyone goes into the profession with those ideas (it's one of the first things I tell people about the profession, along with the reality that vets spend most of their time with people, not animals).   I'm sorry if you've made that mistake.  

Taking paperwork (or computer work) home is NOT common for most practitioners - and in some places isn't even allowed.  The only vets I know who do that occasionally are owners, and they don't get it done at work because they also have management stuff to do.  There certainly are practitioners that have to do that, but that's specific to that clinic and it's not common.  Are students used as free labour?  Of course - just like in most other professional schools, but that's 4 years compared with a career of 25-40 years.  

You've got weird expectations about what privileges a ""professional degree"" should get you......Of course doctors (like many other professionals) work weekends in some jobs - that's because illness and injury doesn't care whether it's a weekday or weekend.  What did you expect?  Not all jobs in veterinary medicine involve clinic work, and not all clinics are open weekends, but those that aren't open weekends are able to do that because of the availability of doctors who DO work weekends in after-hours and ER clinics in many locations.  They have professional degrees too, and I am thankful that they're not too proud of their ""professional degree"" to work weekends.  

I'm sorry you're dissatisfied with your career choice, but I think it's a good profession that has both good and bad jobs (just like any profession).  I think a lot of your dissatisfaction is personal (based on your preconceived notions and unrealistic expectations), and not broadly about vet school (which sucked) or veterinary medicine as a profession.

You also negotiated that salary.  Don't pretend that your employer is the only person to blame for a salary you don't like.  And don't forget that your employer almost assuredly spent more than that salary on you - they spent a lot of additional time with a new grad.

New grads should be thinking about so many other things than money, everything from medical cases to surgical techniques to client communication.  The learning curve is steep getting out of school, and there's no need or benefit to making it a steeper curve.   Additionally, new grads have no way to gauge their ability to make money in the clinic, because they don't know the effect of all those variables that are at play.  What's more, they shouldn't have to - they should be spending their time and brain power on learning to be a better clinician.

Or are you just taking longer at the things you need to do (take a history, do an exam, explain your findings and plans)?  Because that's very common and will get better as you get more experience.  

Sometimes ""multiple concerns"" are so many or complicated that they need to be broken into sequential appointments, but sometimes they can and should be handled at the same time - that's depends on what they are, what the plans are to deal with them, and the limits of the clients' compliance.|>In my experience the places with 20 minute appointments are doing mostly routine/wellness work

That's pretty easy if you are travelling within the US, but it's much more difficult (probably unrealistic) if you wanted to travel to other countries.  Vets are licensed by the state, which is why many relief vets will stay where their current license allows them to work - but that's a choice you might do differently.  

I'm Canadian and only have a license for one province, because licenses here are pretty expensive (over $1000/yr), so I would need a significant amount of work (or a personal reason to go) in different provinces to make that worthwhile.......In the US, different state licenses are much more affordable, which would make it a more realistic option for a relief vet to be licensed in several (many?) states.  Of course, there will be other requirements for licensure in different states (maybe a local test or police screening), but you can decide if those things are worth it to you to travel to different states to work.  

I don't recommend relief work until you've been working as a vet for at least 3-5 years, though, but I do recommend it for vets who are of the right personality and skill level.  I did it for over 15 years, and enjoyed travelling all over the province to work.|Veterinarians Without Borders usually require Canadian citizenship or Permanent Resident status.

> and the contents of an injection I was giving leaked out through the other end of the dog's skin.

I've been out almost 25 years, and it still sometimes happens to me.  Another thing that sometimes happens in long, shaggy-coated dogs is that I give an ""inter-fur"" vaccine and not under the skin at all.  Stuff happens - it's how you manage it that counts.  Did you see what happen and apologize that you needed to give another (or another partial) injection?  Acknowledging it to the clients helps them see that you're human and make mistakes, and can rectify them.  It won't work for all clients, but it helps minimize the issue.  

>The client said no to everything I offered but still complained that I hadn't done anything at all. 

Yeah, that will happen, unfortunately, which is why your records are very important - including what you recommended and what they declined.  I had a client complain to the clinic owner that all I'd done when she'd been in with her cat for urinating outside the litterbox was tell her that her cat was ""fat"".  Dr. Owner opened my record and saw a full page of notes regarding everything I'd discussed behaviourally and physically, with one line that say ""unable to palpate urinary bladder d/t obese"" so no cysto.""  (ultrasounds were uncommon back then.)

>told me to ""recommend"" instead of ""offering"" 

I have 3 levels of urgency when discussing testing for a pet:  ""I want to do this"" if the patient is at risk of a significant problem or disease, ""I recommend we do this"", if I think something will help us work up a minor problem, ""I can do this, if you want"" for something I think is unnecessary at this point in time, but might make an anxious owner feel better (eg FNA on a first exam mass that looks and feels like a lipoma).  

Ultimately, you will have to find the language that works well for you and communicates how you feel about it - and you don't have to use the same terms with every client or every situation.  I was taught to say ""need"" instead of recommend, but I could never get it to sound natural coming out of my mouth - I always felt I was lying.  So I found what worked for me but still served the patients, clients, and clinic owner well.

After just 3 months, these small complaints sound pretty minor......Sounds like you're doing well.|Start by practising on dogs and cats that are under anesthesia.....When they're under GA, you should be able to see the tympanum as a white ""wall"".

I often have to pull the pinna out (i.e. away from the animal) a little to kind of straighten the curve out a bit.|I did ""full time"" relief for over 15 years, and then switched to a part time job about a year or two before Covid.....I still do occasional relief work, but not much any more.   I put ""full time"" in quotes because doing relief was my only job, but I didn't work a full time schedule and some times of the year I was busier than other times.  I was solo, in that I didn't join an employment agency for relief work.

I don't think that being out for only a year is really long enough to have the experience necessary to truly be comfortable working alone (and in 95% of the time I was the only vet) because so much else is also new every week or every day - new staff, new facilities, new drugs on the shelf, new vaccine protocols, etc.   But, I also know everyone is different, including our experiences before we became vets.  

I think the first things you need to do is decide geographically where you're going to look for work (how far are you willing to travel?), and find out what you need to set up what kind of business entity (I'm in Canada, so if you're in the US, I can't recommend anything).   Then start spreading the news in that general area that you're offering relief services.   Set up at least an informational website (I don't recommend taking bookings via your website), and send out some emails.  

Here's the most important thing:  Set up some boundaries for your work, and start thinking about them now.  The more boundaries you have, the fewer number of possible clinics you can work, so don't go overboard on your list, but decide what you're willing to do and not do, and what lines you won't cross.  Is it about vaccine protocols (will you work for a clinic that vaccinates for everything yearly)?  Is it about declaw or tail docking surgeries?  Shelter work (some clinics do surgeries and euthanasias for local shelters)?   Will you work with back to back 15 minute appointments?  Etc......

Those are things you can and should discuss with the clinic owner or manager before you take the job, because once you're there you have a responsibility not to turn away a bunch of business because Dr. Owner does things that you don't like (or can't) do.  I personally recommend you go to visit every clinic before you decide to accept work there - not only does it show general interest and involvement, you might find things that might influence your decision to work there or not (such as whether all the equipment is operational, or whether there's a hole in the ceiling that often allows dust to rain down into the room below).|What kind of unit do you have?

Good - what the clinic is doing isn't wrong, but it's not what you're comfortable with, and that's OK.  I don't see anything ""cagey"" about it, because the clinic is being upfront about what they're doing, and my guess is they've decided those are prospective clients that they are willing and able to lose, for reasons that you don't understand, which is also OK.   That's the owner's call to make.

That vet say's he's willing to provide mentorship, but what he thinks of as ""mentorship"" and what you think of as ""mentorship"" might be two different things - you may not get what you want out of him, but that doesn't mean he's lying or misrepresenting himself.

You misunderstand me if you think I said it's something you need.......Actually, it's something that exists, whether you want it or not, and I think it's something that isn't anything anyone wants in a mentoring situation.  

A vet can't escape that power dynamic in a mentoring situation within a clinic, but sometimes it's not healthy or not the best situation to mentor someone.  What if a mentee wants to deal with a medical situation in a way that is different from their boss, and doesn't know how to approach that situation?  What if one of the professional challenges they face is how to deal with a client who is also the boss' neighbour?

Honestly, though, there aren't many avian specialists around, so many vets that work with birds (pets and rehab) have learned it by unofficially apprenticing with a vet who has decades of experience with birds.  More specialists would be awesome.|Vet students get a free membership to VIN, and it has a lot of tools and advice specifically geared towards students:  [https://www.vin.com/students/default.aspx](https://www.vin.com/students/default.aspx)  Don't be put off by the UI - persevere and it's an amazing resource.

What you're describing is based on your personal experience at one vet school in one specific time frame -- but you're advising other people (who may or may not be like you) about what their experience will be like at one of over 3 dozen vet schools at some unknown point in the future.  I say that as a vet who will happily tell anyone who asks that vet school sucked, but it was what I had to do in order to become a vet, and being a vet is way better than being a vet student.  

I didn't deal with a toxic environment, though I did deal with a few instructors who were a-holes.  That happens in any school or workplace.  That's especially true in an environment where sometimes there are literally lives on the line, and the instructors have to be sure they can fix whatever problems the students create.

Perfectionism is the bane and lifeblood of veterinary medicine, and I think it afflicts students more than it does the instructors (who know how to deal with errors and imperfection).  Perfectionism among vet students, and then vets, is an unfortunate byproduct of the selection system (IMO), and is the source of a lot of the mental health problems in the profession (IMO).

Of course there's no support for all species groups -- do you have any idea how many species that would be?  You're upset because you didn't get instruction on the unique and limited species you wanted to learn about, but that disappointment is on you:  You should have - and could have - know about that before you went to vet school.  All you would have had to do was peruse the courses and ask a few questions on forums like this (or StudentDoctorNetwork) to know that ""niche"" species and areas of interest are really not covered in undergrad vet school.  It takes post grad and extra curricular classes to get to those parts of veterinary medicine.  

That ""you're not a real doctor"" situation you're facing sucks, but it's a reality of the profession and something you definitely could have known about because it's not new.  It's been that way for 50 years, and happens even to specialists.   You've obviously spent time shadowing or working with vets, and you've obviously spent at least a decade being around people and seeing/hearing how they think about vets - didn't you ever see that before?   Anyone who becomes a vet expecting prestige or money has made a mistake, and it's unfortunate that anyone goes into the profession with those ideas (it's one of the first things I tell people about the profession, along with the reality that vets spend most of their time with people, not animals).   I'm sorry if you've made that mistake.  

Taking paperwork (or computer work) home is NOT common for most practitioners - and in some places isn't even allowed.  The only vets I know who do that occasionally are owners, and they don't get it done at work because they also have management stuff to do.  There certainly are practitioners that have to do that, but that's specific to that clinic and it's not common.  Are students used as free labour?  Of course - just like in most other professional schools, but that's 4 years compared with a career of 25-40 years.  

You've got weird expectations about what privileges a ""professional degree"" should get you......Of course doctors (like many other professionals) work weekends in some jobs - that's because illness and injury doesn't care whether it's a weekday or weekend.  What did you expect?  Not all jobs in veterinary medicine involve clinic work, and not all clinics are open weekends, but those that aren't open weekends are able to do that because of the availability of doctors who DO work weekends in after-hours and ER clinics in many locations.  They have professional degrees too, and I am thankful that they're not too proud of their ""professional degree"" to work weekends.  

I'm sorry you're dissatisfied with your career choice, but I think it's a good profession that has both good and bad jobs (just like any profession).  I think a lot of your dissatisfaction is personal (based on your preconceived notions and unrealistic expectations), and not broadly about vet school (which sucked) or veterinary medicine as a profession.  I expected vet school to suck, and it did, but I am so much happier being a vet.|Canada.  Midline.|I'm sorry for the loss of your patient.

Let's start with this being a small animal clinic - things can be very different in situations where one is dealing with assets and not pets.  

In virtually every small animal clinic, pets will only be euthanized for a medical problem (physical or mental) that can't be managed (for practical or financial reasons).  Those animals are not well, and they are typically sedated before they are euthanized.   I've very, very rarely heard any vocalizations, and special pains are taken to make the patient comfortable and pain free.

&#x200B;

>I want to know how much of a windfall my employer has made

You also negotiated that salary.  Don't pretend that your employer is the only person to blame for a salary you don't like.  And don't forget that your employer almost assuredly spent more than that salary on you - they spent a lot of additional time with a new grad.

New grads should be thinking about so many other things than money, everything from medical cases to surgical techniques to client communication.  The learning curve is steep getting out of school, and there's no need or benefit to making it a steeper curve.   Additionally, new grads have no way to gauge their ability to make money in the clinic, because they don't know the effect of all those variables that are at play.  What's more, they shouldn't have to - they should be spending their time and brain power on learning to be a better clinician.

You say you're trying to learn and improve, but you twice told him that you weren't willing to put in any personal time to learn and improve.   He has a right not to expect you to work on your days off, but he was asking to come with him to learn on a day off, and I understand why he sees your unwillingness to do that as frustrating.   He's reasonably expecting you to continue learning when you're off the clock - especially being as new in the profession as you are - so I think you're shooting yourself in the foot.   You are right that you don't have to do it on your day off, but don't expect him to be excited about your lack of motivation and interest in improving.  

If you'd been out 5 or 6 years and he made the same request, I'd have a different answer, but at 1 month post graduation you should be doing a lot of learning and improving both at work and when you're not at work.  

This is not the same as protecting your days off from having to do work for them, and he's not making any money off of the time he's asking you to donate.|>It’s not reasonable to expect a new grad to only be learning on their days off. 

I agree - it's also not reasonable to expect a new grad to only be learning when they're on the job.   Or, to put it another way, I wouldn't want to hire a new grad who only wanted to learn when they were being paid.   New grads are entitled to refuse to take learning opportunities when they're not on the clock, and owners are entitled to not find that very appealing or impressive.  That means new grads have a choice:  They can be excited to learn and improve to help their career, or they can refuse to take the opportunity to learn and improve when someone isn't paying them to do so.|deleted|>If you're only getting one day a week off

The post said they work 4 days a week and one night on call.|Not unless that's what they were promised in their negotiated contract.  It's not a requirement of all bosses and all clinics to do that, and if that was an expectation of the OP, they should have made sure to include those specifics in their contract.  

If not, the boss had a reasonable expectation that a professional new to the profession would take it upon themselves to continue to learn and improve themselves.  If they don't want to take that responsibility themselves, they'll be a lot less attractive as hires because they'll seem a lot less motivated and helpful.  

It seems the OP expects their boss to take personal time to help them - because when they're teaching, they're not working - but isn't willing to take personal time to help themselves.

You are right that you can't continue a career in high anxiety mode all the time, and it's something that plague a lot of new and newish grads, because vet school pre-selects for Type A, high achieving people, often with perfectionist tendencies.

That's pretty easy if you are travelling within the US, but it's much more difficult (probably unrealistic) if you wanted to travel to other countries.  Vets are licensed by the state, which is why many relief vets will stay where their current license allows them to work - but that's a choice you might do differently.  

I'm Canadian and only have a license for one province, because licenses here are pretty expensive (over $1000/yr), so I would need a significant amount of work (or a personal reason to go) in different provinces to make that worthwhile.......In the US, different state licenses are much more affordable, which would make it a more realistic option for a relief vet to be licensed in several (many?) states.  Of course, there will be other requirements for licensure in different states (maybe a local test or police screening), but you can decide if those things are worth it to you to travel to different states to work.  

I don't recommend relief work until you've been working as a vet for at least 3-5 years, though, but I do recommend it for vets who are of the right personality and skill level.

> and the contents of an injection I was giving leaked out through the other end of the dog's skin.

I've been out almost 25 years, and it still sometimes happens to me.  Another thing that sometimes happens in long, shaggy-coated dogs is that I give an ""inter-fur"" vaccine and not under the skin at all.  Stuff happens - it's how you manage it that counts.  Did you see what happen and apologize that you needed to give another (or another partial) injection?  Acknowledging it to the clients helps them see that you're human and make mistakes, and can rectify them.  It won't work for all clients, but it helps minimize the issue.  

>The client said no to everything I offered but still complained that I hadn't done anything at all. 

Yeah, that will happen, unfortunately, which is why your records are very important - including what you recommended and what they declined.  I had a client complain to the clinic owner that all I'd done when she'd been in with her cat for urinating outside the litterbox was tell her that her cat was ""fat"".  Dr. Owner opened my record and saw a full page of notes regarding everything I'd discussed behaviourally and physically, with one line that say ""unable to palpate urinary bladder d/t obese"" so no cysto.""  (ultrasounds were uncommon back then.)

>told me to ""recommend"" instead of ""offering"" 

I have 3 levels of urgency when discussing testing for a pet:  ""I want to do this"" if the patient is at risk of a significant problem or disease, ""I recommend we do this"", if I think something will help us work up a minor problem, ""I can do this, if you want"" for something I think is unnecessary at this point in time, but might make an anxious owner feel better (eg FNA on a first exam mass that looks and feels like a lipoma).  

Ultimately, you will have to find the language that works well for you and communicates how you feel about it - and you don't have to use the same terms with every client or every situation.  I was taught to say ""need"" instead of recommend, but I could never get it to sound natural coming out of my mouth - I always felt I was lying.  So I found what worked for me but still served the patients, clients, and clinic owner well.

I put ""full time"" in quotes because doing relief was my only job, but I didn't work a full time schedule and some times of the year I was busier than other times.  I was solo, in that I didn't join an employment agency for relief work.

I don't think that being out for only a year is really long enough to have the experience necessary to truly be comfortable working alone (and in 95% of the time I was the only vet) because so much else is also new every week or every day - new staff, new facilities, new drugs on the shelf, new vaccine protocols, etc.   But, I also know everyone is different, including our experiences before we became vets.  

I think the first things you need to do is decide geographically where you're going to look for work (how far are you willing to travel?), and find out what you need to set up what kind of business entity (I'm in Canada, so if you're in the US, I can't recommend anything).   Then start spreading the news in that general area that you're offering relief services.   Set up at least an informational website (I don't recommend taking bookings via your website), and send out some emails.  

Here's the most important thing:  Set up some boundaries for your work, and start thinking about them now.  The more boundaries you have, the fewer number of possible clinics you can work, so don't go overboard on your list, but decide what you're willing to do and not do, and what lines you won't cross.  Is it about vaccine protocols (will you work for a clinic that vaccinates for everything yearly)?  Is it about declaw or tail docking surgeries?  Shelter work (some clinics do surgeries and euthanasias for local shelters)?   Will you work with back to back 15 minute appointments?  Etc......

Those are things you can and should discuss with the clinic owner or manager before you take the job, because once you're there you have a responsibility not to turn away a bunch of business because Dr. Owner does things that you don't like (or can't) do.  I personally recommend you go to visit every clinic before you decide to accept work there - not only does it show general interest and involvement, you might find things that might influence your decision to work there or not (such as whether all the equipment is operational, or whether there's a hole in the ceiling that often allows dust to rain down into the room below).|What kind of unit do you have?

Good - what the clinic is doing isn't wrong, but it's not what you're comfortable with, and that's OK.

I've dealt with something similar in a recent special project taught by people who've obviously read too many communication-for-dummies books.

And that's exactly why I think the admission expectations for vet school are all messed up.

They should value experience as waitstaff as highly as they value experience as kennel staff in a clinic (for instance).|Is the practice manager also a veterinarian?  If not, and if there are no standard protocols that have been instituted for particular situations, then: no.   They can suggest a vet what to use, but they can't tell a vet what they should do medically - that would be practising medicine without a license.  

A practise manager can ask a vet to use a certain drug (""we have this in stock, can you use it instead of X?"") or can refuse to make a certain drug available in the clinic (""we can't stock X because it's too expensive and isn't used often enough""), but that's not telling the vet what to do.|OK, it sounds like the PM might not have told the vet what they must use, but instead made a suggestion that they thought the vet should consider.   What language and tone the PM used is important here - if the PM said something like ""you should use this - Dr. Y had a similar case and it worked out well"", then it's a suggestion, and that's very different than ""that drug won't work, you should use this one instead"" which is directing the vet's treatment.

Did the vet think about it and use it instead because the vet thought the suggestion made sense, or did the vet use it instead because they felt they had to or they would face anger or discipline?  You probably don't know, but those are the things that determine if the PM was trying to practise medicine, or trying to make a helpful suggestion.|Then that was wrong - but it's on the vet as much - if not moreso - than the PM.|There's an AviMark help Facebook group - I've gotten some help from them before.|Have you heard of VetLife?

Then there are some species, and some animals with physical limits, that require some ""creative"" techniques and positions.

Animals are obviously sedated for MRIs and CT scans, but that can be counter-productive for fluoroscopy - but these three techniques are more limited to specialty practices than to general practitioner vets.|My friend does house calls for geriatric and palliative care.

Medical doctors don't go to med school and become doctors because they have a ""love and passion for people"".   In my opinion, a clinical vet needs a curiosity and interest in medicine/surgery primarily, and (in small animal medicine) a respect for and desire to support the human-animal bond between owners and pets.|A love of animals had nothing to do with it -- I was interested in medicine, and didn't want to be an MD.|Often at least 2 internships (i.e. 2 years) are required, because it's pretty competitive.....that might not be the case when the OP is graduating.|I haven't done it, but I suspect the change of pace and money would be a tough road (faster pace, less money).

But please know what ""mentorship"" means to you, because it doesn't mean the same thing to everyone.  If you want a ""mentee"" relationship with someone make sure you and they have the same expectations of what that means.

Personally, I think it's better to have a mentor that does not work where you do, especially not your boss - there's a real power dynamic there that can impede a good mentoring situation.|>and never felt the need for a power dynamic.

You misunderstand me if you think I said it's something you need.......Actually, it's something that exists, whether you want it or not, and I think it's something that isn't anything anyone wants in a mentoring situation.  

A vet can't escape that power dynamic in a mentoring situation within a clinic, but sometimes it's not healthy or not the best situation to mentor someone.  What if a mentee wants to deal with a medical situation in a way that is different from their boss, and doesn't know how to approach that situation?  What if one of the professional challenges they face is how to deal with a client who is also the boss' neighbour?  What if a mentee wants to discuss how to face the challenges of contract negotiation, or how to think about the future of their career and other job prospects?  What if they're worried about an ethical situation that they're not ready for their boss to know about?

Mentoring isn't training, and it isn't limited to delivering medical and surgical care.  There's no reason a mentor has to be in the same facility, because the real issues that need to be discussed aren't things that need to be discussed right then.  Training someone how to improve their speed in surgery isn't mentoring, and it's not mentoring to teach someone how to deal with a ruptured anal gland for the first time - mentoring is the big picture issue of discussing and encouraging someone how to solve those problems themselves|Are you a vet?

Yup - there's a surplus of vets out there now.  Your area might be in dire need of vets, but that's not because there aren't vets looking for jobs, it's because most vets are looking for jobs in suburban and urban areas (for various reasons).  Adding more vets won't suddenly make more people want to live in different parts of the country, or live different lifestyles.  

I agree that there's a problem of distribution of vets, not a problem in the number of vets.|>As someone who lives rural you absolutely can just not respond after hours. None of the vets here do.

Don't for a second think you'll be avoiding ""crazy clients"", because you'd be exchanging them for ""crazy clients in grief"".  Don't do it because you think you'll be avoiding stress or needing to learn a bunch of stuff, because there's no such thing as a ""routine"" euthanasia any more than there is a ""routine"" ear infection or ""routine"" surgery.

What you're describing is based on your personal experience at one vet school in one specific time frame -- but you're advising other people (who may or may not be like you) about what their experience will be like at one of over 3 dozen vet schools at some unknown point in the future.  I say that as a vet who will happily tell anyone who asks that vet school sucked, but it was what I had to do in order to become a vet, and being a vet is way better than being a vet student.  

I didn't deal with a toxic environment, though I did deal with a few instructors who were a-holes.  That happens in any school or workplace.  That's especially true in an environment where sometimes there are literally lives on the line, and the instructors have to be sure they can fix whatever problems the students create.

Perfectionism is the bane and lifeblood of veterinary medicine, and I think it afflicts students more than it does the instructors (who know how to deal with errors and imperfection).  Perfectionism among vet students, and then vets, is an unfortunate byproduct of the selection system (IMO), and is the source of a lot of the mental health problems in the profession (IMO).

Of course there's no support for all species groups -- do you have any idea how many species that would be?  You're upset because you didn't get instruction on the unique and limited species you wanted to learn about, but that disappointment is on you:  You should have - and could have - know about that before you went to vet school.  All you would have had to do was peruse the courses and ask a few questions on forums like this (or StudentDoctorNetwork) to know that ""niche"" species and areas of interest are really not covered in undergrad vet school.  It takes post grad and extra curricular classes to get to those parts of veterinary medicine.  

That ""you're not a real doctor"" situation you're facing sucks, but it's a reality of the profession and something you definitely could have known about because it's not new.  It's been that way for 50 years, and happens even to specialists.   You've obviously spent time shadowing or working with vets, and you've obviously spent at least a decade being around people and seeing/hearing how they think about vets - didn't you ever see that before?   Anyone who becomes a vet expecting prestige or money has made a mistake, and it's unfortunate that anyone goes into the profession with those ideas (it's one of the first things I tell people about the profession, along with the reality that vets spend most of their time with people, not animals).   I'm sorry if you've made that mistake.  

Taking paperwork (or computer work) home is NOT common for most practitioners - and in some places isn't even allowed.  The only vets I know who do that occasionally are owners, and they don't get it done at work because they also have management stuff to do.  There certainly are practitioners that have to do that, but that's specific to that clinic and it's not common.  Are students used as free labour?  Of course - just like in most other professional schools, but that's 4 years compared with a career of 25-40 years.  

You've got weird expectations about what privileges a ""professional degree"" should get you......Of course doctors (like many other professionals) work weekends in some jobs - that's because illness and injury doesn't care whether it's a weekday or weekend.  What did you expect?  Not all jobs in veterinary medicine involve clinic work, and not all clinics are open weekends, but those that aren't open weekends are able to do that because of the availability of doctors who DO work weekends in after-hours and ER clinics in many locations.  They have professional degrees too, and I am thankful that they're not too proud of their ""professional degree"" to work weekends.  

I'm sorry you're dissatisfied with your career choice, but I think it's a good profession that has both good and bad jobs (just like any profession).  I think a lot of your dissatisfaction is personal (based on your preconceived notions and unrealistic expectations), and not broadly about vet school (which sucked) or veterinary medicine as a profession.

You also negotiated that salary.  Don't pretend that your employer is the only person to blame for a salary you don't like.  And don't forget that your employer almost assuredly spent more than that salary on you - they spent a lot of additional time with a new grad.

New grads should be thinking about so many other things than money, everything from medical cases to surgical techniques to client communication.  The learning curve is steep getting out of school, and there's no need or benefit to making it a steeper curve.   Additionally, new grads have no way to gauge their ability to make money in the clinic, because they don't know the effect of all those variables that are at play.  What's more, they shouldn't have to - they should be spending their time and brain power on learning to be a better clinician.

Some people will want a stepped introduction into appointments, others will just want someone available by text or phone, and others will want daily (or weekly) debriefing meetings.  

Also, remember that mentors don't have to be your boss (I think it's better if they're not your boss), and you are not limited to having an in clinic mentor.  There are other places you can look for mentorship, so if that's a weak point in the offer, don't worry because you have other options for support.|>What is a good argument a new grad could make against negative accrual?

Or are you just taking longer at the things you need to do (take a history, do an exam, explain your findings and plans)?  Because that's very common and will get better as you get more experience.  

Sometimes ""multiple concerns"" are so many or complicated that they need to be broken into sequential appointments, but sometimes they can and should be handled at the same time - that's depends on what they are, what the plans are to deal with them, and the limits of the clients' compliance.|>In my experience the places with 20 minute appointments are doing mostly routine/wellness work

That's pretty easy if you are travelling within the US, but it's much more difficult (probably unrealistic) if you wanted to travel to other countries.  Vets are licensed by the state, which is why many relief vets will stay where their current license allows them to work - but that's a choice you might do differently.  

I'm Canadian and only have a license for one province, because licenses here are pretty expensive (over $1000/yr), so I would need a significant amount of work (or a personal reason to go) in different provinces to make that worthwhile.......In the US, different state licenses are much more affordable, which would make it a more realistic option for a relief vet to be licensed in several (many?) states.  Of course, there will be other requirements for licensure in different states (maybe a local test or police screening), but you can decide if those things are worth it to you to travel to different states to work.  

I don't recommend relief work until you've been working as a vet for at least 3-5 years, though, but I do recommend it for vets who are of the right personality and skill level.  I did it for over 15 years, and enjoyed travelling all over the province to work.|Veterinarians Without Borders usually require Canadian citizenship or Permanent Resident status.

> and the contents of an injection I was giving leaked out through the other end of the dog's skin.

I've been out almost 25 years, and it still sometimes happens to me.  Another thing that sometimes happens in long, shaggy-coated dogs is that I give an ""inter-fur"" vaccine and not under the skin at all.  Stuff happens - it's how you manage it that counts.  Did you see what happen and apologize that you needed to give another (or another partial) injection?  Acknowledging it to the clients helps them see that you're human and make mistakes, and can rectify them.  It won't work for all clients, but it helps minimize the issue.  

>The client said no to everything I offered but still complained that I hadn't done anything at all. 

Yeah, that will happen, unfortunately, which is why your records are very important - including what you recommended and what they declined.  I had a client complain to the clinic owner that all I'd done when she'd been in with her cat for urinating outside the litterbox was tell her that her cat was ""fat"".  Dr. Owner opened my record and saw a full page of notes regarding everything I'd discussed behaviourally and physically, with one line that say ""unable to palpate urinary bladder d/t obese"" so no cysto.""  (ultrasounds were uncommon back then.)

>told me to ""recommend"" instead of ""offering"" 

I have 3 levels of urgency when discussing testing for a pet:  ""I want to do this"" if the patient is at risk of a significant problem or disease, ""I recommend we do this"", if I think something will help us work up a minor problem, ""I can do this, if you want"" for something I think is unnecessary at this point in time, but might make an anxious owner feel better (eg FNA on a first exam mass that looks and feels like a lipoma).  

Ultimately, you will have to find the language that works well for you and communicates how you feel about it - and you don't have to use the same terms with every client or every situation.  I was taught to say ""need"" instead of recommend, but I could never get it to sound natural coming out of my mouth - I always felt I was lying.  So I found what worked for me but still served the patients, clients, and clinic owner well.

After just 3 months, these small complaints sound pretty minor......Sounds like you're doing well.|Start by practising on dogs and cats that are under anesthesia.....When they're under GA, you should be able to see the tympanum as a white ""wall"".

I often have to pull the pinna out (i.e. away from the animal) a little to kind of straighten the curve out a bit.|I did ""full time"" relief for over 15 years, and then switched to a part time job about a year or two before Covid.....I still do occasional relief work, but not much any more.   I put ""full time"" in quotes because doing relief was my only job, but I didn't work a full time schedule and some times of the year I was busier than other times.  I was solo, in that I didn't join an employment agency for relief work.

I don't think that being out for only a year is really long enough to have the experience necessary to truly be comfortable working alone (and in 95% of the time I was the only vet) because so much else is also new every week or every day - new staff, new facilities, new drugs on the shelf, new vaccine protocols, etc.   But, I also know everyone is different, including our experiences before we became vets.  

I think the first things you need to do is decide geographically where you're going to look for work (how far are you willing to travel?), and find out what you need to set up what kind of business entity (I'm in Canada, so if you're in the US, I can't recommend anything).   Then start spreading the news in that general area that you're offering relief services.   Set up at least an informational website (I don't recommend taking bookings via your website), and send out some emails.  

Here's the most important thing:  Set up some boundaries for your work, and start thinking about them now.  The more boundaries you have, the fewer number of possible clinics you can work, so don't go overboard on your list, but decide what you're willing to do and not do, and what lines you won't cross.  Is it about vaccine protocols (will you work for a clinic that vaccinates for everything yearly)?  Is it about declaw or tail docking surgeries?  Shelter work (some clinics do surgeries and euthanasias for local shelters)?   Will you work with back to back 15 minute appointments?  Etc......

Those are things you can and should discuss with the clinic owner or manager before you take the job, because once you're there you have a responsibility not to turn away a bunch of business because Dr. Owner does things that you don't like (or can't) do.  I personally recommend you go to visit every clinic before you decide to accept work there - not only does it show general interest and involvement, you might find things that might influence your decision to work there or not (such as whether all the equipment is operational, or whether there's a hole in the ceiling that often allows dust to rain down into the room below).|What kind of unit do you have?

Good - what the clinic is doing isn't wrong, but it's not what you're comfortable with, and that's OK.  I don't see anything ""cagey"" about it, because the clinic is being upfront about what they're doing, and my guess is they've decided those are prospective clients that they are willing and able to lose, for reasons that you don't understand, which is also OK.   That's the owner's call to make.

You want your boss to be understanding of new grads, but if you don't connect well with that vet, there are other ways to find mentorship.   That vet say's he's willing to provide mentorship, but what he thinks of as ""mentorship"" and what you think of as ""mentorship"" might be two different things - you may not get what you want out of him, but that doesn't mean he's lying or misrepresenting himself.  

I recommend you don't work on any production based pay scheme, at least for the first year, because you simply don't know enough about the clinic or how it works to know how, let alone how much, you'll produce.

You misunderstand me if you think I said it's something you need.......Actually, it's something that exists, whether you want it or not, and I think it's something that isn't anything anyone wants in a mentoring situation.  

A vet can't escape that power dynamic in a mentoring situation within a clinic, but sometimes it's not healthy or not the best situation to mentor someone.  What if a mentee wants to deal with a medical situation in a way that is different from their boss, and doesn't know how to approach that situation?  What if one of the professional challenges they face is how to deal with a client who is also the boss' neighbour?

What if they're worried about an ethical situation that they're not ready for their boss to know about?

There's no reason a mentor has to be in the same facility, because the real issues that need to be discussed aren't things that need to be discussed right then.

Don't for a second think you'll be avoiding ""crazy clients"", because you'd be exchanging them for ""crazy clients in grief"".  Don't do it because you think you'll be avoiding stress or needing to learn a bunch of stuff, because there's no such thing as a ""routine"" euthanasia any more than there is a ""routine"" ear infection or ""routine"" surgery.   It will create possibly more stress, not less stress, because it's every owner's worst day, and you have to be a bit of a counsellor as well as a vet.

Honestly, though, there aren't many avian specialists around, so many vets that work with birds (pets and rehab) have learned it by unofficially apprenticing with a vet who has decades of experience with birds.  More specialists would be awesome.|Vet students get a free membership to VIN, and it has a lot of tools and advice specifically geared towards students:  [https://www.vin.com/students/default.aspx](https://www.vin.com/students/default.aspx)  Don't be put off by the UI - persevere and it's an amazing resource.

What you're describing is based on your personal experience at one vet school in one specific time frame -- but you're advising other people (who may or may not be like you) about what their experience will be like at one of over 3 dozen vet schools at some unknown point in the future.  I say that as a vet who will happily tell anyone who asks that vet school sucked, but it was what I had to do in order to become a vet, and being a vet is way better than being a vet student.  

I didn't deal with a toxic environment, though I did deal with a few instructors who were a-holes.  That happens in any school or workplace.  That's especially true in an environment where sometimes there are literally lives on the line, and the instructors have to be sure they can fix whatever problems the students create.

Perfectionism is the bane and lifeblood of veterinary medicine, and I think it afflicts students more than it does the instructors (who know how to deal with errors and imperfection).  Perfectionism among vet students, and then vets, is an unfortunate byproduct of the selection system (IMO), and is the source of a lot of the mental health problems in the profession (IMO).

Of course there's no support for all species groups -- do you have any idea how many species that would be?  You're upset because you didn't get instruction on the unique and limited species you wanted to learn about, but that disappointment is on you:  You should have - and could have - know about that before you went to vet school.  All you would have had to do was peruse the courses and ask a few questions on forums like this (or StudentDoctorNetwork) to know that ""niche"" species and areas of interest are really not covered in undergrad vet school.  It takes post grad and extra curricular classes to get to those parts of veterinary medicine.  

That ""you're not a real doctor"" situation you're facing sucks, but it's a reality of the profession and something you definitely could have known about because it's not new.  It's been that way for 50 years, and happens even to specialists.   You've obviously spent time shadowing or working with vets, and you've obviously spent at least a decade being around people and seeing/hearing how they think about vets - didn't you ever see that before?   Anyone who becomes a vet expecting prestige or money has made a mistake, and it's unfortunate that anyone goes into the profession with those ideas (it's one of the first things I tell people about the profession, along with the reality that vets spend most of their time with people, not animals).   I'm sorry if you've made that mistake.  

Taking paperwork (or computer work) home is NOT common for most practitioners - and in some places isn't even allowed.  The only vets I know who do that occasionally are owners, and they don't get it done at work because they also have management stuff to do.  There certainly are practitioners that have to do that, but that's specific to that clinic and it's not common.  Are students used as free labour?  Of course - just like in most other professional schools, but that's 4 years compared with a career of 25-40 years.  

You've got weird expectations about what privileges a ""professional degree"" should get you......Of course doctors (like many other professionals) work weekends in some jobs - that's because illness and injury doesn't care whether it's a weekday or weekend.  What did you expect?  Not all jobs in veterinary medicine involve clinic work, and not all clinics are open weekends, but those that aren't open weekends are able to do that because of the availability of doctors who DO work weekends in after-hours and ER clinics in many locations.  They have professional degrees too, and I am thankful that they're not too proud of their ""professional degree"" to work weekends.  

I'm sorry you're dissatisfied with your career choice, but I think it's a good profession that has both good and bad jobs (just like any profession).  I think a lot of your dissatisfaction is personal (based on your preconceived notions and unrealistic expectations), and not broadly about vet school (which sucked) or veterinary medicine as a profession.  I expected vet school to suck, and it did, but I am so much happier being a vet.|Canada.  Midline.|I'm sorry for the loss of your patient.

Let's start with this being a small animal clinic - things can be very different in situations where one is dealing with assets and not pets.  

In virtually every small animal clinic, pets will only be euthanized for a medical problem (physical or mental) that can't be managed (for practical or financial reasons).  Those animals are not well, and they are typically sedated before they are euthanized.   I've very, very rarely heard any vocalizations, and special pains are taken to make the patient comfortable and pain free.

Midline incision for cat and dog spays, pre-scrotal for dog neuters, scrotal for cat neuters.  Monocryl for all sutures, unless there's a lot of fat, then I use a braided for those ligations.

>I want to know how much of a windfall my employer has made

You also negotiated that salary.  Don't pretend that your employer is the only person to blame for a salary you don't like.  And don't forget that your employer almost assuredly spent more than that salary on you - they spent a lot of additional time with a new grad.

New grads should be thinking about so many other things than money, everything from medical cases to surgical techniques to client communication.  The learning curve is steep getting out of school, and there's no need or benefit to making it a steeper curve.   Additionally, new grads have no way to gauge their ability to make money in the clinic, because they don't know the effect of all those variables that are at play.  What's more, they shouldn't have to - they should be spending their time and brain power on learning to be a better clinician.

Yes, and I think you set your boundaries in the wrong place.  You say you're trying to learn and improve, but you twice told him that you weren't willing to put in any personal time to learn and improve.   He has a right not to expect you to work on your days off, but he was asking to come with him to learn on a day off, and I understand why he sees your unwillingness to do that as frustrating.   He's reasonably expecting you to continue learning when you're off the clock - especially being as new in the profession as you are - so I think you're shooting yourself in the foot.   You are right that you don't have to do it on your day off, but don't expect him to be excited about your lack of motivation and interest in improving.  

If you'd been out 5 or 6 years and he made the same request, I'd have a different answer, but at 1 month post graduation you should be doing a lot of learning and improving both at work and when you're not at work.  

This is not the same as protecting your days off from having to do work for them, and he's not making any money off of the time he's asking you to donate.|>It’s not reasonable to expect a new grad to only be learning on their days off. 

I agree - it's also not reasonable to expect a new grad to only be learning when they're on the job.   Or, to put it another way, I wouldn't want to hire a new grad who only wanted to learn when they were being paid.   New grads are entitled to refuse to take learning opportunities when they're not on the clock, and owners are entitled to not find that very appealing or impressive.  That means new grads have a choice:  They can be excited to learn and improve to help their career, or they can refuse to take the opportunity to learn and improve when someone isn't paying them to do so.|deleted|>If you're only getting one day a week off

It's not a requirement of all bosses and all clinics to do that, and if that was an expectation of the OP, they should have made sure to include those specifics in their contract.  

If not, the boss had a reasonable expectation that a professional new to the profession would take it upon themselves to continue to learn and improve themselves.  If they don't want to take that responsibility themselves, they'll be a lot less attractive as hires because they'll seem a lot less motivated and helpful.  

It seems the OP expects their boss to take personal time to help them - because when they're teaching, they're not working - but isn't willing to take personal time to help themselves.

You are right that you can't continue a career in high anxiety mode all the time, and it's something that plague a lot of new and newish grads, because vet school pre-selects for Type A, high achieving people, often with perfectionist tendencies.

That's pretty easy if you are travelling within the US, but it's much more difficult (probably unrealistic) if you wanted to travel to other countries.  Vets are licensed by the state, which is why many relief vets will stay where their current license allows them to work - but that's a choice you might do differently.  

I'm Canadian and only have a license for one province, because licenses here are pretty expensive (over $1000/yr), so I would need a significant amount of work (or a personal reason to go) in different provinces to make that worthwhile.......In the US, different state licenses are much more affordable, which would make it a more realistic option for a relief vet to be licensed in several (many?) states.  Of course, there will be other requirements for licensure in different states (maybe a local test or police screening), but you can decide if those things are worth it to you to travel to different states to work.  

I don't recommend relief work until you've been working as a vet for at least 3-5 years, though, but I do recommend it for vets who are of the right personality and skill level.

> and the contents of an injection I was giving leaked out through the other end of the dog's skin.

I've been out almost 25 years, and it still sometimes happens to me.  Another thing that sometimes happens in long, shaggy-coated dogs is that I give an ""inter-fur"" vaccine and not under the skin at all.  Stuff happens - it's how you manage it that counts.  Did you see what happen and apologize that you needed to give another (or another partial) injection?  Acknowledging it to the clients helps them see that you're human and make mistakes, and can rectify them.  It won't work for all clients, but it helps minimize the issue.  

>The client said no to everything I offered but still complained that I hadn't done anything at all. 

Yeah, that will happen, unfortunately, which is why your records are very important - including what you recommended and what they declined.  I had a client complain to the clinic owner that all I'd done when she'd been in with her cat for urinating outside the litterbox was tell her that her cat was ""fat"".  Dr. Owner opened my record and saw a full page of notes regarding everything I'd discussed behaviourally and physically, with one line that say ""unable to palpate urinary bladder d/t obese"" so no cysto.""  (ultrasounds were uncommon back then.)

>told me to ""recommend"" instead of ""offering"" 

I have 3 levels of urgency when discussing testing for a pet:  ""I want to do this"" if the patient is at risk of a significant problem or disease, ""I recommend we do this"", if I think something will help us work up a minor problem, ""I can do this, if you want"" for something I think is unnecessary at this point in time, but might make an anxious owner feel better (eg FNA on a first exam mass that looks and feels like a lipoma).  

Ultimately, you will have to find the language that works well for you and communicates how you feel about it - and you don't have to use the same terms with every client or every situation.  I was taught to say ""need"" instead of recommend, but I could never get it to sound natural coming out of my mouth - I always felt I was lying.  So I found what worked for me but still served the patients, clients, and clinic owner well.

I put ""full time"" in quotes because doing relief was my only job, but I didn't work a full time schedule and some times of the year I was busier than other times.  I was solo, in that I didn't join an employment agency for relief work.

I don't think that being out for only a year is really long enough to have the experience necessary to truly be comfortable working alone (and in 95% of the time I was the only vet) because so much else is also new every week or every day - new staff, new facilities, new drugs on the shelf, new vaccine protocols, etc.   But, I also know everyone is different, including our experiences before we became vets.  

I think the first things you need to do is decide geographically where you're going to look for work (how far are you willing to travel?), and find out what you need to set up what kind of business entity (I'm in Canada, so if you're in the US, I can't recommend anything).   Then start spreading the news in that general area that you're offering relief services.   Set up at least an informational website (I don't recommend taking bookings via your website), and send out some emails.  

Here's the most important thing:  Set up some boundaries for your work, and start thinking about them now.  The more boundaries you have, the fewer number of possible clinics you can work, so don't go overboard on your list, but decide what you're willing to do and not do, and what lines you won't cross.  Is it about vaccine protocols (will you work for a clinic that vaccinates for everything yearly)?  Is it about declaw or tail docking surgeries?  Shelter work (some clinics do surgeries and euthanasias for local shelters)?   Will you work with back to back 15 minute appointments?  Etc......

Those are things you can and should discuss with the clinic owner or manager before you take the job, because once you're there you have a responsibility not to turn away a bunch of business because Dr. Owner does things that you don't like (or can't) do.  I personally recommend you go to visit every clinic before you decide to accept work there - not only does it show general interest and involvement, you might find things that might influence your decision to work there or not (such as whether all the equipment is operational, or whether there's a hole in the ceiling that often allows dust to rain down into the room below).|What kind of unit do you have?

Good - what the clinic is doing isn't wrong, but it's not what you're comfortable with, and that's OK.

If not, and if there are no standard protocols that have been instituted for particular situations, then: no.   They can suggest a vet what to use, but they can't tell a vet what they should do medically - that would be practising medicine without a license.  

A practise manager can ask a vet to use a certain drug (""we have this in stock, can you use it instead of X?"") or can refuse to make a certain drug available in the clinic (""we can't stock X because it's too expensive and isn't used often enough""), but that's not telling the vet what to do.|OK, it sounds like the PM might not have told the vet what they must use, but instead made a suggestion that they thought the vet should consider.

Did the vet think about it and use it instead because the vet thought the suggestion made sense, or did the vet use it instead because they felt they had to or they would face anger or discipline?

Then there are some species, and some animals with physical limits, that require some ""creative"" techniques and positions.

In my opinion, a clinical vet needs a curiosity and interest in medicine/surgery primarily, and (in small animal medicine) a respect for and desire to support the human-animal bond between owners and pets.|A love of animals had nothing to do with it -- I was interested in medicine, and didn't want to be an MD.|Often at least 2 internships (i.e. 2 years) are required, because it's pretty competitive.....that might not be the case when the OP is graduating.|I haven't done it, but I suspect the change of pace and money would be a tough road (faster pace, less money).

But please know what ""mentorship"" means to you, because it doesn't mean the same thing to everyone.  If you want a ""mentee"" relationship with someone make sure you and they have the same expectations of what that means.

Personally, I think it's better to have a mentor that does not work where you do, especially not your boss - there's a real power dynamic there that can impede a good mentoring situation.|>and never felt the need for a power dynamic.

You misunderstand me if you think I said it's something you need.......Actually, it's something that exists, whether you want it or not, and I think it's something that isn't anything anyone wants in a mentoring situation.  

A vet can't escape that power dynamic in a mentoring situation within a clinic, but sometimes it's not healthy or not the best situation to mentor someone.  What if a mentee wants to deal with a medical situation in a way that is different from their boss, and doesn't know how to approach that situation?  What if one of the professional challenges they face is how to deal with a client who is also the boss' neighbour?  What if a mentee wants to discuss how to face the challenges of contract negotiation, or how to think about the future of their career and other job prospects?  What if they're worried about an ethical situation that they're not ready for their boss to know about?

Mentoring isn't training, and it isn't limited to delivering medical and surgical care.  There's no reason a mentor has to be in the same facility, because the real issues that need to be discussed aren't things that need to be discussed right then.  Training someone how to improve their speed in surgery isn't mentoring, and it's not mentoring to teach someone how to deal with a ruptured anal gland for the first time - mentoring is the big picture issue of discussing and encouraging someone how to solve those problems themselves|Are you a vet?

Yup - there's a surplus of vets out there now.  Your area might be in dire need of vets, but that's not because there aren't vets looking for jobs, it's because most vets are looking for jobs in suburban and urban areas (for various reasons).  Adding more vets won't suddenly make more people want to live in different parts of the country, or live different lifestyles.  

I agree that there's a problem of distribution of vets, not a problem in the number of vets.|>As someone who lives rural you absolutely can just not respond after hours. None of the vets here do.

That depends on where you practice -- in some places, vets have an obligation to respond after hours and they can be sanctioned if they don't.|>For example the dakotas, nevada, new mexico, wyoming, etc. dont have vet schools so the only people moving to those states to be vets are people who left them for vet school originally.

Don't for a second think you'll be avoiding ""crazy clients"", because you'd be exchanging them for ""crazy clients in grief"".  Don't do it because you think you'll be avoiding stress or needing to learn a bunch of stuff, because there's no such thing as a ""routine"" euthanasia any more than there is a ""routine"" ear infection or ""routine"" surgery.   It will create possibly more stress, not less stress, because it's every owner's worst day, and you have to be a bit of a counsellor as well as a vet.

What you're describing is based on your personal experience at one vet school in one specific time frame -- but you're advising other people (who may or may not be like you) about what their experience will be like at one of over 3 dozen vet schools at some unknown point in the future.  I say that as a vet who will happily tell anyone who asks that vet school sucked, but it was what I had to do in order to become a vet, and being a vet is way better than being a vet student.  

I didn't deal with a toxic environment, though I did deal with a few instructors who were a-holes.  That happens in any school or workplace.  That's especially true in an environment where sometimes there are literally lives on the line, and the instructors have to be sure they can fix whatever problems the students create.

Perfectionism is the bane and lifeblood of veterinary medicine, and I think it afflicts students more than it does the instructors (who know how to deal with errors and imperfection).  Perfectionism among vet students, and then vets, is an unfortunate byproduct of the selection system (IMO), and is the source of a lot of the mental health problems in the profession (IMO).

Of course there's no support for all species groups -- do you have any idea how many species that would be?  You're upset because you didn't get instruction on the unique and limited species you wanted to learn about, but that disappointment is on you:  You should have - and could have - know about that before you went to vet school.  All you would have had to do was peruse the courses and ask a few questions on forums like this (or StudentDoctorNetwork) to know that ""niche"" species and areas of interest are really not covered in undergrad vet school.  It takes post grad and extra curricular classes to get to those parts of veterinary medicine.  

That ""you're not a real doctor"" situation you're facing sucks, but it's a reality of the profession and something you definitely could have known about because it's not new.  It's been that way for 50 years, and happens even to specialists.   You've obviously spent time shadowing or working with vets, and you've obviously spent at least a decade being around people and seeing/hearing how they think about vets - didn't you ever see that before?   Anyone who becomes a vet expecting prestige or money has made a mistake, and it's unfortunate that anyone goes into the profession with those ideas (it's one of the first things I tell people about the profession, along with the reality that vets spend most of their time with people, not animals).   I'm sorry if you've made that mistake.  

Taking paperwork (or computer work) home is NOT common for most practitioners - and in some places isn't even allowed.  The only vets I know who do that occasionally are owners, and they don't get it done at work because they also have management stuff to do.  There certainly are practitioners that have to do that, but that's specific to that clinic and it's not common.  Are students used as free labour?  Of course - just like in most other professional schools, but that's 4 years compared with a career of 25-40 years.  

You've got weird expectations about what privileges a ""professional degree"" should get you......Of course doctors (like many other professionals) work weekends in some jobs - that's because illness and injury doesn't care whether it's a weekday or weekend.  What did you expect?  Not all jobs in veterinary medicine involve clinic work, and not all clinics are open weekends, but those that aren't open weekends are able to do that because of the availability of doctors who DO work weekends in after-hours and ER clinics in many locations.  They have professional degrees too, and I am thankful that they're not too proud of their ""professional degree"" to work weekends.  

I'm sorry you're dissatisfied with your career choice, but I think it's a good profession that has both good and bad jobs (just like any profession).  I think a lot of your dissatisfaction is personal (based on your preconceived notions and unrealistic expectations), and not broadly about vet school (which sucked) or veterinary medicine as a profession.

New grads should be thinking about so many other things than money, everything from medical cases to surgical techniques to client communication.  The learning curve is steep getting out of school, and there's no need or benefit to making it a steeper curve.   Additionally, new grads have no way to gauge their ability to make money in the clinic, because they don't know the effect of all those variables that are at play.  What's more, they shouldn't have to - they should be spending their time and brain power on learning to be a better clinician.  

I'm against production-based pay in general, but I'm particularly against it for new grads, for at least the first 6-12 months.|>I'm sorry if you can't comprehend that a person can simultaneously focus on improving at their job while also calculating how much their effort is worth to their employer.

I can comprehend it, but I think it's wrong and wrongheaded.  I know vets that do it, and I think they're spending their time and mental energy on the wrong things at that stage of their career.  

Of course you should fight for a fair salary, and I think it's not wrong to know how much gross income you earned the clinic in your first year *in order to assess how your year went* (your boss will do the same), but assessing your contributions for the  year is different than worrying about production ahead of time, or (worse) while you're working.|I agree that it seems odd that it developed so far from surgery, and it makes me wonder about the dog's healing or clotting.

What they think is mentorship and what you think is mentorship might be different things.  Probably are.  Sure, you want them to define it, but you need to define it to yourself first.  What do you want?   If you don't know what you want and think is ""mentorship"", then what they provide to you will be meaningless - you won't know whether it's good or bad or in between.  Some people will want a stepped introduction into appointments, others will just want someone available by text or phone, and others will want daily (or weekly) debriefing meetings.  

Also, remember that mentors don't have to be your boss (I think it's better if they're not your boss), and you are not limited to having an in clinic mentor.  There are other places you can look for mentorship, so if that's a weak point in the offer, don't worry because you have other options for support.|>What is a good argument a new grad could make against negative accrual?

Or are you just taking longer at the things you need to do (take a history, do an exam, explain your findings and plans)?  Because that's very common and will get better as you get more experience.  

Sometimes ""multiple concerns"" are so many or complicated that they need to be broken into sequential appointments, but sometimes they can and should be handled at the same time - that's depends on what they are, what the plans are to deal with them, and the limits of the clients' compliance.|>In my experience the places with 20 minute appointments are doing mostly routine/wellness work

That's pretty easy if you are travelling within the US, but it's much more difficult (probably unrealistic) if you wanted to travel to other countries.  Vets are licensed by the state, which is why many relief vets will stay where their current license allows them to work - but that's a choice you might do differently.  

I'm Canadian and only have a license for one province, because licenses here are pretty expensive (over $1000/yr), so I would need a significant amount of work (or a personal reason to go) in different provinces to make that worthwhile.......In the US, different state licenses are much more affordable, which would make it a more realistic option for a relief vet to be licensed in several (many?) states.  Of course, there will be other requirements for licensure in different states (maybe a local test or police screening), but you can decide if those things are worth it to you to travel to different states to work.  

I don't recommend relief work until you've been working as a vet for at least 3-5 years, though, but I do recommend it for vets who are of the right personality and skill level.  I did it for over 15 years, and enjoyed travelling all over the province to work.|Veterinarians Without Borders usually require Canadian citizenship or Permanent Resident status.

> and the contents of an injection I was giving leaked out through the other end of the dog's skin.

I've been out almost 25 years, and it still sometimes happens to me.  Another thing that sometimes happens in long, shaggy-coated dogs is that I give an ""inter-fur"" vaccine and not under the skin at all.  Stuff happens - it's how you manage it that counts.  Did you see what happen and apologize that you needed to give another (or another partial) injection?  Acknowledging it to the clients helps them see that you're human and make mistakes, and can rectify them.  It won't work for all clients, but it helps minimize the issue.  

>The client said no to everything I offered but still complained that I hadn't done anything at all. 

Yeah, that will happen, unfortunately, which is why your records are very important - including what you recommended and what they declined.  I had a client complain to the clinic owner that all I'd done when she'd been in with her cat for urinating outside the litterbox was tell her that her cat was ""fat"".  Dr. Owner opened my record and saw a full page of notes regarding everything I'd discussed behaviourally and physically, with one line that say ""unable to palpate urinary bladder d/t obese"" so no cysto.""  (ultrasounds were uncommon back then.)

>told me to ""recommend"" instead of ""offering"" 

I have 3 levels of urgency when discussing testing for a pet:  ""I want to do this"" if the patient is at risk of a significant problem or disease, ""I recommend we do this"", if I think something will help us work up a minor problem, ""I can do this, if you want"" for something I think is unnecessary at this point in time, but might make an anxious owner feel better (eg FNA on a first exam mass that looks and feels like a lipoma).  

Ultimately, you will have to find the language that works well for you and communicates how you feel about it - and you don't have to use the same terms with every client or every situation.  I was taught to say ""need"" instead of recommend, but I could never get it to sound natural coming out of my mouth - I always felt I was lying.  So I found what worked for me but still served the patients, clients, and clinic owner well.

After just 3 months, these small complaints sound pretty minor......Sounds like you're doing well.|Start by practising on dogs and cats that are under anesthesia.....When they're under GA, you should be able to see the tympanum as a white ""wall"".

I often have to pull the pinna out (i.e. away from the animal) a little to kind of straighten the curve out a bit.|I did ""full time"" relief for over 15 years, and then switched to a part time job about a year or two before Covid.....I still do occasional relief work, but not much any more.   I put ""full time"" in quotes because doing relief was my only job, but I didn't work a full time schedule and some times of the year I was busier than other times.  I was solo, in that I didn't join an employment agency for relief work.

I don't think that being out for only a year is really long enough to have the experience necessary to truly be comfortable working alone (and in 95% of the time I was the only vet) because so much else is also new every week or every day - new staff, new facilities, new drugs on the shelf, new vaccine protocols, etc.   But, I also know everyone is different, including our experiences before we became vets.  

I think the first things you need to do is decide geographically where you're going to look for work (how far are you willing to travel?), and find out what you need to set up what kind of business entity (I'm in Canada, so if you're in the US, I can't recommend anything).   Then start spreading the news in that general area that you're offering relief services.   Set up at least an informational website (I don't recommend taking bookings via your website), and send out some emails.  

Here's the most important thing:  Set up some boundaries for your work, and start thinking about them now.  The more boundaries you have, the fewer number of possible clinics you can work, so don't go overboard on your list, but decide what you're willing to do and not do, and what lines you won't cross.  Is it about vaccine protocols (will you work for a clinic that vaccinates for everything yearly)?  Is it about declaw or tail docking surgeries?  Shelter work (some clinics do surgeries and euthanasias for local shelters)?   Will you work with back to back 15 minute appointments?  Etc......

Those are things you can and should discuss with the clinic owner or manager before you take the job, because once you're there you have a responsibility not to turn away a bunch of business because Dr. Owner does things that you don't like (or can't) do.  I personally recommend you go to visit every clinic before you decide to accept work there - not only does it show general interest and involvement, you might find things that might influence your decision to work there or not (such as whether all the equipment is operational, or whether there's a hole in the ceiling that often allows dust to rain down into the room below).|What kind of unit do you have?

Good - what the clinic is doing isn't wrong, but it's not what you're comfortable with, and that's OK.  I don't see anything ""cagey"" about it, because the clinic is being upfront about what they're doing, and my guess is they've decided those are prospective clients that they are willing and able to lose, for reasons that you don't understand, which is also OK.   That's the owner's call to make.

You want your boss to be understanding of new grads, but if you don't connect well with that vet, there are other ways to find mentorship.   That vet say's he's willing to provide mentorship, but what he thinks of as ""mentorship"" and what you think of as ""mentorship"" might be two different things - you may not get what you want out of him, but that doesn't mean he's lying or misrepresenting himself.  

I recommend you don't work on any production based pay scheme, at least for the first year, because you simply don't know enough about the clinic or how it works to know how, let alone how much, you'll produce.

You misunderstand me if you think I said it's something you need.......Actually, it's something that exists, whether you want it or not, and I think it's something that isn't anything anyone wants in a mentoring situation.  

A vet can't escape that power dynamic in a mentoring situation within a clinic, but sometimes it's not healthy or not the best situation to mentor someone.  What if a mentee wants to deal with a medical situation in a way that is different from their boss, and doesn't know how to approach that situation?  What if one of the professional challenges they face is how to deal with a client who is also the boss' neighbour?

There's no reason a mentor has to be in the same facility, because the real issues that need to be discussed aren't things that need to be discussed right then.

Yup - there's a surplus of vets out there now.  Your area might be in dire need of vets, but that's not because there aren't vets looking for jobs, it's because most vets are looking for jobs in suburban and urban areas (for various reasons).  Adding more vets won't suddenly make more people want to live in different parts of the country, or live different lifestyles.  

I agree that there's a problem of distribution of vets, not a problem in the number of vets.|>As someone who lives rural you absolutely can just not respond after hours. None of the vets here do.

That depends on where you practice -- in some places, vets have an obligation to respond after hours and they can be sanctioned if they don't.|>For example the dakotas, nevada, new mexico, wyoming, etc. dont have vet schools so the only people moving to those states to be vets are people who left them for vet school originally.

Don't for a second think you'll be avoiding ""crazy clients"", because you'd be exchanging them for ""crazy clients in grief"".  Don't do it because you think you'll be avoiding stress or needing to learn a bunch of stuff, because there's no such thing as a ""routine"" euthanasia any more than there is a ""routine"" ear infection or ""routine"" surgery.   It will create possibly more stress, not less stress, because it's every owner's worst day, and you have to be a bit of a counsellor as well as a vet.

Honestly, though, there aren't many avian specialists around, so many vets that work with birds (pets and rehab) have learned it by unofficially apprenticing with a vet who has decades of experience with birds.

What you're describing is based on your personal experience at one vet school in one specific time frame -- but you're advising other people (who may or may not be like you) about what their experience will be like at one of over 3 dozen vet schools at some unknown point in the future.  I say that as a vet who will happily tell anyone who asks that vet school sucked, but it was what I had to do in order to become a vet, and being a vet is way better than being a vet student.  

I didn't deal with a toxic environment, though I did deal with a few instructors who were a-holes.  That happens in any school or workplace.  That's especially true in an environment where sometimes there are literally lives on the line, and the instructors have to be sure they can fix whatever problems the students create.

Perfectionism is the bane and lifeblood of veterinary medicine, and I think it afflicts students more than it does the instructors (who know how to deal with errors and imperfection).  Perfectionism among vet students, and then vets, is an unfortunate byproduct of the selection system (IMO), and is the source of a lot of the mental health problems in the profession (IMO).

Of course there's no support for all species groups -- do you have any idea how many species that would be?  You're upset because you didn't get instruction on the unique and limited species you wanted to learn about, but that disappointment is on you:  You should have - and could have - know about that before you went to vet school.  All you would have had to do was peruse the courses and ask a few questions on forums like this (or StudentDoctorNetwork) to know that ""niche"" species and areas of interest are really not covered in undergrad vet school.  It takes post grad and extra curricular classes to get to those parts of veterinary medicine.  

That ""you're not a real doctor"" situation you're facing sucks, but it's a reality of the profession and something you definitely could have known about because it's not new.  It's been that way for 50 years, and happens even to specialists.   You've obviously spent time shadowing or working with vets, and you've obviously spent at least a decade being around people and seeing/hearing how they think about vets - didn't you ever see that before?   Anyone who becomes a vet expecting prestige or money has made a mistake, and it's unfortunate that anyone goes into the profession with those ideas (it's one of the first things I tell people about the profession, along with the reality that vets spend most of their time with people, not animals).   I'm sorry if you've made that mistake.  

Taking paperwork (or computer work) home is NOT common for most practitioners - and in some places isn't even allowed.  The only vets I know who do that occasionally are owners, and they don't get it done at work because they also have management stuff to do.  There certainly are practitioners that have to do that, but that's specific to that clinic and it's not common.  Are students used as free labour?  Of course - just like in most other professional schools, but that's 4 years compared with a career of 25-40 years.  

You've got weird expectations about what privileges a ""professional degree"" should get you......Of course doctors (like many other professionals) work weekends in some jobs - that's because illness and injury doesn't care whether it's a weekday or weekend.  What did you expect?  Not all jobs in veterinary medicine involve clinic work, and not all clinics are open weekends, but those that aren't open weekends are able to do that because of the availability of doctors who DO work weekends in after-hours and ER clinics in many locations.  They have professional degrees too, and I am thankful that they're not too proud of their ""professional degree"" to work weekends.  

I'm sorry you're dissatisfied with your career choice, but I think it's a good profession that has both good and bad jobs (just like any profession).  I think a lot of your dissatisfaction is personal (based on your preconceived notions and unrealistic expectations), and not broadly about vet school (which sucked) or veterinary medicine as a profession.  I expected vet school to suck, and it did, but I am so much happier being a vet.|Canada.  Midline.|I'm sorry for the loss of your patient.

Let's start with this being a small animal clinic - things can be very different in situations where one is dealing with assets and not pets.  

In virtually every small animal clinic, pets will only be euthanized for a medical problem (physical or mental) that can't be managed (for practical or financial reasons).  Those animals are not well, and they are typically sedated before they are euthanized.   I've very, very rarely heard any vocalizations, and special pains are taken to make the patient comfortable and pain free.

You also negotiated that salary.  Don't pretend that your employer is the only person to blame for a salary you don't like.  And don't forget that your employer almost assuredly spent more than that salary on you - they spent a lot of additional time with a new grad.

New grads should be thinking about so many other things than money, everything from medical cases to surgical techniques to client communication.  The learning curve is steep getting out of school, and there's no need or benefit to making it a steeper curve.   Additionally, new grads have no way to gauge their ability to make money in the clinic, because they don't know the effect of all those variables that are at play.  What's more, they shouldn't have to - they should be spending their time and brain power on learning to be a better clinician.

A mature canine spay, or an immature feline spay, etc.  The technicians book the surgery mornings and are very good at approximating the time involved for each procedure to keep her busy.  Turn around time between surgeries is minimal, because she typically works with 3 technicians, and they induce all patients into surgery (and monitor recoveries, as well).

Yes, and I think you set your boundaries in the wrong place.  You say you're trying to learn and improve, but you twice told him that you weren't willing to put in any personal time to learn and improve.   He has a right not to expect you to work on your days off, but he was asking to come with him to learn on a day off, and I understand why he sees your unwillingness to do that as frustrating.   He's reasonably expecting you to continue learning when you're off the clock - especially being as new in the profession as you are - so I think you're shooting yourself in the foot.   You are right that you don't have to do it on your day off, but don't expect him to be excited about your lack of motivation and interest in improving.  

If you'd been out 5 or 6 years and he made the same request, I'd have a different answer, but at 1 month post graduation you should be doing a lot of learning and improving both at work and when you're not at work.  

This is not the same as protecting your days off from having to do work for them, and he's not making any money off of the time he's asking you to donate.|>It’s not reasonable to expect a new grad to only be learning on their days off. 

I agree - it's also not reasonable to expect a new grad to only be learning when they're on the job.   Or, to put it another way, I wouldn't want to hire a new grad who only wanted to learn when they were being paid.   New grads are entitled to refuse to take learning opportunities when they're not on the clock, and owners are entitled to not find that very appealing or impressive.  That means new grads have a choice:  They can be excited to learn and improve to help their career, or they can refuse to take the opportunity to learn and improve when someone isn't paying them to do so.|deleted|>If you're only getting one day a week off

It's not a requirement of all bosses and all clinics to do that, and if that was an expectation of the OP, they should have made sure to include those specifics in their contract.  

If not, the boss had a reasonable expectation that a professional new to the profession would take it upon themselves to continue to learn and improve themselves.  If they don't want to take that responsibility themselves, they'll be a lot less attractive as hires because they'll seem a lot less motivated and helpful.  

It seems the OP expects their boss to take personal time to help them - because when they're teaching, they're not working - but isn't willing to take personal time to help themselves.

That's pretty easy if you are travelling within the US, but it's much more difficult (probably unrealistic) if you wanted to travel to other countries.  Vets are licensed by the state, which is why many relief vets will stay where their current license allows them to work - but that's a choice you might do differently.  

I'm Canadian and only have a license for one province, because licenses here are pretty expensive (over $1000/yr), so I would need a significant amount of work (or a personal reason to go) in different provinces to make that worthwhile.......In the US, different state licenses are much more affordable, which would make it a more realistic option for a relief vet to be licensed in several (many?) states.  Of course, there will be other requirements for licensure in different states (maybe a local test or police screening), but you can decide if those things are worth it to you to travel to different states to work.  

I don't recommend relief work until you've been working as a vet for at least 3-5 years, though, but I do recommend it for vets who are of the right personality and skill level.

> and the contents of an injection I was giving leaked out through the other end of the dog's skin.

I've been out almost 25 years, and it still sometimes happens to me.  Another thing that sometimes happens in long, shaggy-coated dogs is that I give an ""inter-fur"" vaccine and not under the skin at all.  Stuff happens - it's how you manage it that counts.  Did you see what happen and apologize that you needed to give another (or another partial) injection?  Acknowledging it to the clients helps them see that you're human and make mistakes, and can rectify them.  It won't work for all clients, but it helps minimize the issue.  

>The client said no to everything I offered but still complained that I hadn't done anything at all. 

Yeah, that will happen, unfortunately, which is why your records are very important - including what you recommended and what they declined.  I had a client complain to the clinic owner that all I'd done when she'd been in with her cat for urinating outside the litterbox was tell her that her cat was ""fat"".  Dr. Owner opened my record and saw a full page of notes regarding everything I'd discussed behaviourally and physically, with one line that say ""unable to palpate urinary bladder d/t obese"" so no cysto.""  (ultrasounds were uncommon back then.)

>told me to ""recommend"" instead of ""offering"" 

I have 3 levels of urgency when discussing testing for a pet:  ""I want to do this"" if the patient is at risk of a significant problem or disease, ""I recommend we do this"", if I think something will help us work up a minor problem, ""I can do this, if you want"" for something I think is unnecessary at this point in time, but might make an anxious owner feel better (eg FNA on a first exam mass that looks and feels like a lipoma).  

Ultimately, you will have to find the language that works well for you and communicates how you feel about it - and you don't have to use the same terms with every client or every situation.  I was taught to say ""need"" instead of recommend, but I could never get it to sound natural coming out of my mouth - I always felt I was lying.  So I found what worked for me but still served the patients, clients, and clinic owner well.

I put ""full time"" in quotes because doing relief was my only job, but I didn't work a full time schedule and some times of the year I was busier than other times.  I was solo, in that I didn't join an employment agency for relief work.

I don't think that being out for only a year is really long enough to have the experience necessary to truly be comfortable working alone (and in 95% of the time I was the only vet) because so much else is also new every week or every day - new staff, new facilities, new drugs on the shelf, new vaccine protocols, etc.   But, I also know everyone is different, including our experiences before we became vets.  

I think the first things you need to do is decide geographically where you're going to look for work (how far are you willing to travel?), and find out what you need to set up what kind of business entity (I'm in Canada, so if you're in the US, I can't recommend anything).   Then start spreading the news in that general area that you're offering relief services.   Set up at least an informational website (I don't recommend taking bookings via your website), and send out some emails.  

Here's the most important thing:  Set up some boundaries for your work, and start thinking about them now.  The more boundaries you have, the fewer number of possible clinics you can work, so don't go overboard on your list, but decide what you're willing to do and not do, and what lines you won't cross.  Is it about vaccine protocols (will you work for a clinic that vaccinates for everything yearly)?  Is it about declaw or tail docking surgeries?  Shelter work (some clinics do surgeries and euthanasias for local shelters)?   Will you work with back to back 15 minute appointments?  Etc......

Those are things you can and should discuss with the clinic owner or manager before you take the job, because once you're there you have a responsibility not to turn away a bunch of business because Dr. Owner does things that you don't like (or can't) do.  I personally recommend you go to visit every clinic before you decide to accept work there - not only does it show general interest and involvement, you might find things that might influence your decision to work there or not (such as whether all the equipment is operational, or whether there's a hole in the ceiling that often allows dust to rain down into the room below).|What kind of unit do you have?

Good - what the clinic is doing isn't wrong, but it's not what you're comfortable with, and that's OK.  I don't see anything ""cagey"" about it, because the clinic is being upfront about what they're doing, and my guess is they've decided those are prospective clients that they are willing and able to lose, for reasons that you don't understand, which is also OK.

Don't think of veterinary technicians like that - the job of technicians is valuable, but it's also very different from that of a vet.  It's not ""lesser"", so there's no ""at least"" about it.  The first thing you should do is spend some time in a clinic (or several clinics, if you can) so you can see what the jobs of vets and techs are.

They should value experience as waitstaff as highly as they value experience as kennel staff in a clinic (for instance).|Is the practice manager also a veterinarian?  If not, and if there are no standard protocols that have been instituted for particular situations, then: no.   They can suggest a vet what to use, but they can't tell a vet what they should do medically - that would be practising medicine without a license.  

A practise manager can ask a vet to use a certain drug (""we have this in stock, can you use it instead of X?"") or can refuse to make a certain drug available in the clinic (""we can't stock X because it's too expensive and isn't used often enough""), but that's not telling the vet what to do.|OK, it sounds like the PM might not have told the vet what they must use, but instead made a suggestion that they thought the vet should consider.   What language and tone the PM used is important here - if the PM said something like ""you should use this - Dr. Y had a similar case and it worked out well"", then it's a suggestion, and that's very different than ""that drug won't work, you should use this one instead"" which is directing the vet's treatment.

Did the vet think about it and use it instead because the vet thought the suggestion made sense, or did the vet use it instead because they felt they had to or they would face anger or discipline?

For the vast, vast majority of vets (those working in clinical medicine), this is a medical degree - we are doctors, but our patients happen to be animals rather than people.

But please know what ""mentorship"" means to you, because it doesn't mean the same thing to everyone.  If you want a ""mentee"" relationship with someone make sure you and they have the same expectations of what that means.

Personally, I think it's better to have a mentor that does not work where you do, especially not your boss - there's a real power dynamic there that can impede a good mentoring situation.|>and never felt the need for a power dynamic.

You misunderstand me if you think I said it's something you need.......Actually, it's something that exists, whether you want it or not, and I think it's something that isn't anything anyone wants in a mentoring situation.  

A vet can't escape that power dynamic in a mentoring situation within a clinic, but sometimes it's not healthy or not the best situation to mentor someone.  What if a mentee wants to deal with a medical situation in a way that is different from their boss, and doesn't know how to approach that situation?  What if one of the professional challenges they face is how to deal with a client who is also the boss' neighbour?  What if a mentee wants to discuss how to face the challenges of contract negotiation, or how to think about the future of their career and other job prospects?  What if they're worried about an ethical situation that they're not ready for their boss to know about?

Mentoring isn't training, and it isn't limited to delivering medical and surgical care.  There's no reason a mentor has to be in the same facility, because the real issues that need to be discussed aren't things that need to be discussed right then.  Training someone how to improve their speed in surgery isn't mentoring, and it's not mentoring to teach someone how to deal with a ruptured anal gland for the first time - mentoring is the big picture issue of discussing and encouraging someone how to solve those problems themselves|Are you a vet?

Yup - there's a surplus of vets out there now.  Your area might be in dire need of vets, but that's not because there aren't vets looking for jobs, it's because most vets are looking for jobs in suburban and urban areas (for various reasons).  Adding more vets won't suddenly make more people want to live in different parts of the country, or live different lifestyles.  

I agree that there's a problem of distribution of vets, not a problem in the number of vets.|>As someone who lives rural you absolutely can just not respond after hours. None of the vets here do.

Don't for a second think you'll be avoiding ""crazy clients"", because you'd be exchanging them for ""crazy clients in grief"".  Don't do it because you think you'll be avoiding stress or needing to learn a bunch of stuff, because there's no such thing as a ""routine"" euthanasia any more than there is a ""routine"" ear infection or ""routine"" surgery.   It will create possibly more stress, not less stress, because it's every owner's worst day, and you have to be a bit of a counsellor as well as a vet.

What you're describing is based on your personal experience at one vet school in one specific time frame -- but you're advising other people (who may or may not be like you) about what their experience will be like at one of over 3 dozen vet schools at some unknown point in the future.  I say that as a vet who will happily tell anyone who asks that vet school sucked, but it was what I had to do in order to become a vet, and being a vet is way better than being a vet student.  

I didn't deal with a toxic environment, though I did deal with a few instructors who were a-holes.  That happens in any school or workplace.  That's especially true in an environment where sometimes there are literally lives on the line, and the instructors have to be sure they can fix whatever problems the students create.

Perfectionism is the bane and lifeblood of veterinary medicine, and I think it afflicts students more than it does the instructors (who know how to deal with errors and imperfection).  Perfectionism among vet students, and then vets, is an unfortunate byproduct of the selection system (IMO), and is the source of a lot of the mental health problems in the profession (IMO).

Of course there's no support for all species groups -- do you have any idea how many species that would be?  You're upset because you didn't get instruction on the unique and limited species you wanted to learn about, but that disappointment is on you:  You should have - and could have - know about that before you went to vet school.  All you would have had to do was peruse the courses and ask a few questions on forums like this (or StudentDoctorNetwork) to know that ""niche"" species and areas of interest are really not covered in undergrad vet school.  It takes post grad and extra curricular classes to get to those parts of veterinary medicine.  

That ""you're not a real doctor"" situation you're facing sucks, but it's a reality of the profession and something you definitely could have known about because it's not new.  It's been that way for 50 years, and happens even to specialists.   You've obviously spent time shadowing or working with vets, and you've obviously spent at least a decade being around people and seeing/hearing how they think about vets - didn't you ever see that before?   Anyone who becomes a vet expecting prestige or money has made a mistake, and it's unfortunate that anyone goes into the profession with those ideas (it's one of the first things I tell people about the profession, along with the reality that vets spend most of their time with people, not animals).   I'm sorry if you've made that mistake.  

Taking paperwork (or computer work) home is NOT common for most practitioners - and in some places isn't even allowed.  The only vets I know who do that occasionally are owners, and they don't get it done at work because they also have management stuff to do.  There certainly are practitioners that have to do that, but that's specific to that clinic and it's not common.  Are students used as free labour?  Of course - just like in most other professional schools, but that's 4 years compared with a career of 25-40 years.  

You've got weird expectations about what privileges a ""professional degree"" should get you......Of course doctors (like many other professionals) work weekends in some jobs - that's because illness and injury doesn't care whether it's a weekday or weekend.  What did you expect?  Not all jobs in veterinary medicine involve clinic work, and not all clinics are open weekends, but those that aren't open weekends are able to do that because of the availability of doctors who DO work weekends in after-hours and ER clinics in many locations.  They have professional degrees too, and I am thankful that they're not too proud of their ""professional degree"" to work weekends.  

I'm sorry you're dissatisfied with your career choice, but I think it's a good profession that has both good and bad jobs (just like any profession).  I think a lot of your dissatisfaction is personal (based on your preconceived notions and unrealistic expectations), and not broadly about vet school (which sucked) or veterinary medicine as a profession.

You also negotiated that salary.  Don't pretend that your employer is the only person to blame for a salary you don't like.  And don't forget that your employer almost assuredly spent more than that salary on you - they spent a lot of additional time with a new grad.

New grads should be thinking about so many other things than money, everything from medical cases to surgical techniques to client communication.  The learning curve is steep getting out of school, and there's no need or benefit to making it a steeper curve.   Additionally, new grads have no way to gauge their ability to make money in the clinic, because they don't know the effect of all those variables that are at play.  What's more, they shouldn't have to - they should be spending their time and brain power on learning to be a better clinician.

Clients should not have your personal phone number or email address - all requests for communication should go through the clinic.   Your talented staff should address whatever they can (questions about appointments, flea/tick meds, food, etc), and then pass messages to you for the things they can't (medication refills or adjustments, etc).

What they think is mentorship and what you think is mentorship might be different things.  Probably are.  Sure, you want them to define it, but you need to define it to yourself first.  What do you want?   If you don't know what you want and think is ""mentorship"", then what they provide to you will be meaningless - you won't know whether it's good or bad or in between.  Some people will want a stepped introduction into appointments, others will just want someone available by text or phone, and others will want daily (or weekly) debriefing meetings.  

Also, remember that mentors don't have to be your boss (I think it's better if they're not your boss), and you are not limited to having an in clinic mentor.

That's pretty easy if you are travelling within the US, but it's much more difficult (probably unrealistic) if you wanted to travel to other countries.  Vets are licensed by the state, which is why many relief vets will stay where their current license allows them to work - but that's a choice you might do differently.  

I'm Canadian and only have a license for one province, because licenses here are pretty expensive (over $1000/yr), so I would need a significant amount of work (or a personal reason to go) in different provinces to make that worthwhile.......In the US, different state licenses are much more affordable, which would make it a more realistic option for a relief vet to be licensed in several (many?) states.  Of course, there will be other requirements for licensure in different states (maybe a local test or police screening), but you can decide if those things are worth it to you to travel to different states to work.  

I don't recommend relief work until you've been working as a vet for at least 3-5 years, though, but I do recommend it for vets who are of the right personality and skill level.  I did it for over 15 years, and enjoyed travelling all over the province to work.|Veterinarians Without Borders usually require Canadian citizenship or Permanent Resident status.

> and the contents of an injection I was giving leaked out through the other end of the dog's skin.

I've been out almost 25 years, and it still sometimes happens to me.  Another thing that sometimes happens in long, shaggy-coated dogs is that I give an ""inter-fur"" vaccine and not under the skin at all.  Stuff happens - it's how you manage it that counts.  Did you see what happen and apologize that you needed to give another (or another partial) injection?  Acknowledging it to the clients helps them see that you're human and make mistakes, and can rectify them.  It won't work for all clients, but it helps minimize the issue.  

>The client said no to everything I offered but still complained that I hadn't done anything at all. 

Yeah, that will happen, unfortunately, which is why your records are very important - including what you recommended and what they declined.  I had a client complain to the clinic owner that all I'd done when she'd been in with her cat for urinating outside the litterbox was tell her that her cat was ""fat"".  Dr. Owner opened my record and saw a full page of notes regarding everything I'd discussed behaviourally and physically, with one line that say ""unable to palpate urinary bladder d/t obese"" so no cysto.""  (ultrasounds were uncommon back then.)

>told me to ""recommend"" instead of ""offering"" 

I have 3 levels of urgency when discussing testing for a pet:  ""I want to do this"" if the patient is at risk of a significant problem or disease, ""I recommend we do this"", if I think something will help us work up a minor problem, ""I can do this, if you want"" for something I think is unnecessary at this point in time, but might make an anxious owner feel better (eg FNA on a first exam mass that looks and feels like a lipoma).  

Ultimately, you will have to find the language that works well for you and communicates how you feel about it - and you don't have to use the same terms with every client or every situation.  I was taught to say ""need"" instead of recommend, but I could never get it to sound natural coming out of my mouth - I always felt I was lying.  So I found what worked for me but still served the patients, clients, and clinic owner well.

After just 3 months, these small complaints sound pretty minor......Sounds like you're doing well.|Start by practising on dogs and cats that are under anesthesia.....When they're under GA, you should be able to see the tympanum as a white ""wall"".

I often have to pull the pinna out (i.e. away from the animal) a little to kind of straighten the curve out a bit.|I did ""full time"" relief for over 15 years, and then switched to a part time job about a year or two before Covid.....I still do occasional relief work, but not much any more.   I put ""full time"" in quotes because doing relief was my only job, but I didn't work a full time schedule and some times of the year I was busier than other times.  I was solo, in that I didn't join an employment agency for relief work.

I don't think that being out for only a year is really long enough to have the experience necessary to truly be comfortable working alone (and in 95% of the time I was the only vet) because so much else is also new every week or every day - new staff, new facilities, new drugs on the shelf, new vaccine protocols, etc.   But, I also know everyone is different, including our experiences before we became vets.  

I think the first things you need to do is decide geographically where you're going to look for work (how far are you willing to travel?), and find out what you need to set up what kind of business entity (I'm in Canada, so if you're in the US, I can't recommend anything).   Then start spreading the news in that general area that you're offering relief services.   Set up at least an informational website (I don't recommend taking bookings via your website), and send out some emails.  

Here's the most important thing:  Set up some boundaries for your work, and start thinking about them now.  The more boundaries you have, the fewer number of possible clinics you can work, so don't go overboard on your list, but decide what you're willing to do and not do, and what lines you won't cross.  Is it about vaccine protocols (will you work for a clinic that vaccinates for everything yearly)?  Is it about declaw or tail docking surgeries?  Shelter work (some clinics do surgeries and euthanasias for local shelters)?   Will you work with back to back 15 minute appointments?  Etc......

Those are things you can and should discuss with the clinic owner or manager before you take the job, because once you're there you have a responsibility not to turn away a bunch of business because Dr. Owner does things that you don't like (or can't) do.  I personally recommend you go to visit every clinic before you decide to accept work there - not only does it show general interest and involvement, you might find things that might influence your decision to work there or not (such as whether all the equipment is operational, or whether there's a hole in the ceiling that often allows dust to rain down into the room below).|What kind of unit do you have?

Good - what the clinic is doing isn't wrong, but it's not what you're comfortable with, and that's OK.  I don't see anything ""cagey"" about it, because the clinic is being upfront about what they're doing, and my guess is they've decided those are prospective clients that they are willing and able to lose, for reasons that you don't understand, which is also OK.   That's the owner's call to make.

You want your boss to be understanding of new grads, but if you don't connect well with that vet, there are other ways to find mentorship.   That vet say's he's willing to provide mentorship, but what he thinks of as ""mentorship"" and what you think of as ""mentorship"" might be two different things - you may not get what you want out of him, but that doesn't mean he's lying or misrepresenting himself.  

I recommend you don't work on any production based pay scheme, at least for the first year, because you simply don't know enough about the clinic or how it works to know how, let alone how much, you'll produce.

You misunderstand me if you think I said it's something you need.......Actually, it's something that exists, whether you want it or not, and I think it's something that isn't anything anyone wants in a mentoring situation.  

A vet can't escape that power dynamic in a mentoring situation within a clinic, but sometimes it's not healthy or not the best situation to mentor someone.  What if a mentee wants to deal with a medical situation in a way that is different from their boss, and doesn't know how to approach that situation?  What if one of the professional challenges they face is how to deal with a client who is also the boss' neighbour?  What if a mentee wants to discuss how to face the challenges of contract negotiation, or how to think about the future of their career and other job prospects?  What if they're worried about an ethical situation that they're not ready for their boss to know about?

Mentoring isn't training, and it isn't limited to delivering medical and surgical care.  There's no reason a mentor has to be in the same facility, because the real issues that need to be discussed aren't things that need to be discussed right then.  Training someone how to improve their speed in surgery isn't mentoring, and it's not mentoring to teach someone how to deal with a ruptured anal gland for the first time - mentoring is the big picture issue of discussing and encouraging someone how to solve those problems themselves|Are you a vet?

Yup - there's a surplus of vets out there now.  Your area might be in dire need of vets, but that's not because there aren't vets looking for jobs, it's because most vets are looking for jobs in suburban and urban areas (for various reasons).  Adding more vets won't suddenly make more people want to live in different parts of the country, or live different lifestyles.  

I agree that there's a problem of distribution of vets, not a problem in the number of vets.|>As someone who lives rural you absolutely can just not respond after hours. None of the vets here do.

That depends on where you practice -- in some places, vets have an obligation to respond after hours and they can be sanctioned if they don't.|>For example the dakotas, nevada, new mexico, wyoming, etc. dont have vet schools so the only people moving to those states to be vets are people who left them for vet school originally.

Don't for a second think you'll be avoiding ""crazy clients"", because you'd be exchanging them for ""crazy clients in grief"".  Don't do it because you think you'll be avoiding stress or needing to learn a bunch of stuff, because there's no such thing as a ""routine"" euthanasia any more than there is a ""routine"" ear infection or ""routine"" surgery.   It will create possibly more stress, not less stress, because it's every owner's worst day, and you have to be a bit of a counsellor as well as a vet.

Honestly, though, there aren't many avian specialists around, so many vets that work with birds (pets and rehab) have learned it by unofficially apprenticing with a vet who has decades of experience with birds.  More specialists would be awesome.|Vet students get a free membership to VIN, and it has a lot of tools and advice specifically geared towards students:  [https://www.vin.com/students/default.aspx](https://www.vin.com/students/default.aspx)  Don't be put off by the UI - persevere and it's an amazing resource.

What you're describing is based on your personal experience at one vet school in one specific time frame -- but you're advising other people (who may or may not be like you) about what their experience will be like at one of over 3 dozen vet schools at some unknown point in the future.  I say that as a vet who will happily tell anyone who asks that vet school sucked, but it was what I had to do in order to become a vet, and being a vet is way better than being a vet student.  

I didn't deal with a toxic environment, though I did deal with a few instructors who were a-holes.  That happens in any school or workplace.  That's especially true in an environment where sometimes there are literally lives on the line, and the instructors have to be sure they can fix whatever problems the students create.

Perfectionism is the bane and lifeblood of veterinary medicine, and I think it afflicts students more than it does the instructors (who know how to deal with errors and imperfection).  Perfectionism among vet students, and then vets, is an unfortunate byproduct of the selection system (IMO), and is the source of a lot of the mental health problems in the profession (IMO).

Of course there's no support for all species groups -- do you have any idea how many species that would be?  You're upset because you didn't get instruction on the unique and limited species you wanted to learn about, but that disappointment is on you:  You should have - and could have - know about that before you went to vet school.  All you would have had to do was peruse the courses and ask a few questions on forums like this (or StudentDoctorNetwork) to know that ""niche"" species and areas of interest are really not covered in undergrad vet school.  It takes post grad and extra curricular classes to get to those parts of veterinary medicine.  

That ""you're not a real doctor"" situation you're facing sucks, but it's a reality of the profession and something you definitely could have known about because it's not new.  It's been that way for 50 years, and happens even to specialists.   You've obviously spent time shadowing or working with vets, and you've obviously spent at least a decade being around people and seeing/hearing how they think about vets - didn't you ever see that before?   Anyone who becomes a vet expecting prestige or money has made a mistake, and it's unfortunate that anyone goes into the profession with those ideas (it's one of the first things I tell people about the profession, along with the reality that vets spend most of their time with people, not animals).   I'm sorry if you've made that mistake.  

Taking paperwork (or computer work) home is NOT common for most practitioners - and in some places isn't even allowed.  The only vets I know who do that occasionally are owners, and they don't get it done at work because they also have management stuff to do.  There certainly are practitioners that have to do that, but that's specific to that clinic and it's not common.  Are students used as free labour?  Of course - just like in most other professional schools, but that's 4 years compared with a career of 25-40 years.  

You've got weird expectations about what privileges a ""professional degree"" should get you......Of course doctors (like many other professionals) work weekends in some jobs - that's because illness and injury doesn't care whether it's a weekday or weekend.  What did you expect?  Not all jobs in veterinary medicine involve clinic work, and not all clinics are open weekends, but those that aren't open weekends are able to do that because of the availability of doctors who DO work weekends in after-hours and ER clinics in many locations.  They have professional degrees too, and I am thankful that they're not too proud of their ""professional degree"" to work weekends.  

I'm sorry you're dissatisfied with your career choice, but I think it's a good profession that has both good and bad jobs (just like any profession).  I think a lot of your dissatisfaction is personal (based on your preconceived notions and unrealistic expectations), and not broadly about vet school (which sucked) or veterinary medicine as a profession.  I expected vet school to suck, and it did, but I am so much happier being a vet.|Canada.  Midline.|I'm sorry for the loss of your patient.

Let's start with this being a small animal clinic - things can be very different in situations where one is dealing with assets and not pets.  

In virtually every small animal clinic, pets will only be euthanized for a medical problem (physical or mental) that can't be managed (for practical or financial reasons).  Those animals are not well, and they are typically sedated before they are euthanized.   I've very, very rarely heard any vocalizations, and special pains are taken to make the patient comfortable and pain free.

Midline incision for cat and dog spays, pre-scrotal for dog neuters, scrotal for cat neuters.  Monocryl for all sutures, unless there's a lot of fat, then I use a braided for those ligations.

You also negotiated that salary.  Don't pretend that your employer is the only person to blame for a salary you don't like.  And don't forget that your employer almost assuredly spent more than that salary on you - they spent a lot of additional time with a new grad.

New grads should be thinking about so many other things than money, everything from medical cases to surgical techniques to client communication.  The learning curve is steep getting out of school, and there's no need or benefit to making it a steeper curve.   Additionally, new grads have no way to gauge their ability to make money in the clinic, because they don't know the effect of all those variables that are at play.  What's more, they shouldn't have to - they should be spending their time and brain power on learning to be a better clinician.

In my opinion, a clinical vet needs a curiosity and interest in medicine/surgery primarily, and (in small animal medicine) a respect for and desire to support the human-animal bond between owners and pets.|Have you asked them to be sure to record their notes about it?

A mature canine spay, or an immature feline spay, etc.  The technicians book the surgery mornings and are very good at approximating the time involved for each procedure to keep her busy.

Yes, and I think you set your boundaries in the wrong place.  You say you're trying to learn and improve, but you twice told him that you weren't willing to put in any personal time to learn and improve.   He has a right not to expect you to work on your days off, but he was asking to come with him to learn on a day off, and I understand why he sees your unwillingness to do that as frustrating.   He's reasonably expecting you to continue learning when you're off the clock - especially being as new in the profession as you are - so I think you're shooting yourself in the foot.   You are right that you don't have to do it on your day off, but don't expect him to be excited about your lack of motivation and interest in improving.  

If you'd been out 5 or 6 years and he made the same request, I'd have a different answer, but at 1 month post graduation you should be doing a lot of learning and improving both at work and when you're not at work.

Or, to put it another way, I wouldn't want to hire a new grad who only wanted to learn when they were being paid.   New grads are entitled to refuse to take learning opportunities when they're not on the clock, and owners are entitled to not find that very appealing or impressive.

If they don't want to take that responsibility themselves, they'll be a lot less attractive as hires because they'll seem a lot less motivated and helpful.

That's pretty easy if you are travelling within the US, but it's much more difficult (probably unrealistic) if you wanted to travel to other countries.  Vets are licensed by the state, which is why many relief vets will stay where their current license allows them to work - but that's a choice you might do differently.  

I'm Canadian and only have a license for one province, because licenses here are pretty expensive (over $1000/yr), so I would need a significant amount of work (or a personal reason to go) in different provinces to make that worthwhile.......In the US, different state licenses are much more affordable, which would make it a more realistic option for a relief vet to be licensed in several (many?) states.  Of course, there will be other requirements for licensure in different states (maybe a local test or police screening), but you can decide if those things are worth it to you to travel to different states to work.  

I don't recommend relief work until you've been working as a vet for at least 3-5 years, though, but I do recommend it for vets who are of the right personality and skill level.

> and the contents of an injection I was giving leaked out through the other end of the dog's skin.

I've been out almost 25 years, and it still sometimes happens to me.  Another thing that sometimes happens in long, shaggy-coated dogs is that I give an ""inter-fur"" vaccine and not under the skin at all.  Stuff happens - it's how you manage it that counts.  Did you see what happen and apologize that you needed to give another (or another partial) injection?  Acknowledging it to the clients helps them see that you're human and make mistakes, and can rectify them.  It won't work for all clients, but it helps minimize the issue.  

>The client said no to everything I offered but still complained that I hadn't done anything at all. 

Yeah, that will happen, unfortunately, which is why your records are very important - including what you recommended and what they declined.  I had a client complain to the clinic owner that all I'd done when she'd been in with her cat for urinating outside the litterbox was tell her that her cat was ""fat"".  Dr. Owner opened my record and saw a full page of notes regarding everything I'd discussed behaviourally and physically, with one line that say ""unable to palpate urinary bladder d/t obese"" so no cysto.""  (ultrasounds were uncommon back then.)

>told me to ""recommend"" instead of ""offering"" 

I have 3 levels of urgency when discussing testing for a pet:  ""I want to do this"" if the patient is at risk of a significant problem or disease, ""I recommend we do this"", if I think something will help us work up a minor problem, ""I can do this, if you want"" for something I think is unnecessary at this point in time, but might make an anxious owner feel better (eg FNA on a first exam mass that looks and feels like a lipoma).  

Ultimately, you will have to find the language that works well for you and communicates how you feel about it - and you don't have to use the same terms with every client or every situation.  I was taught to say ""need"" instead of recommend, but I could never get it to sound natural coming out of my mouth - I always felt I was lying.  So I found what worked for me but still served the patients, clients, and clinic owner well.

I put ""full time"" in quotes because doing relief was my only job, but I didn't work a full time schedule and some times of the year I was busier than other times.  I was solo, in that I didn't join an employment agency for relief work.

I don't think that being out for only a year is really long enough to have the experience necessary to truly be comfortable working alone (and in 95% of the time I was the only vet) because so much else is also new every week or every day - new staff, new facilities, new drugs on the shelf, new vaccine protocols, etc.   But, I also know everyone is different, including our experiences before we became vets.  

I think the first things you need to do is decide geographically where you're going to look for work (how far are you willing to travel?), and find out what you need to set up what kind of business entity (I'm in Canada, so if you're in the US, I can't recommend anything).   Then start spreading the news in that general area that you're offering relief services.   Set up at least an informational website (I don't recommend taking bookings via your website), and send out some emails.  

Here's the most important thing:  Set up some boundaries for your work, and start thinking about them now.  The more boundaries you have, the fewer number of possible clinics you can work, so don't go overboard on your list, but decide what you're willing to do and not do, and what lines you won't cross.  Is it about vaccine protocols (will you work for a clinic that vaccinates for everything yearly)?  Is it about declaw or tail docking surgeries?  Shelter work (some clinics do surgeries and euthanasias for local shelters)?   Will you work with back to back 15 minute appointments?  Etc......

Those are things you can and should discuss with the clinic owner or manager before you take the job, because once you're there you have a responsibility not to turn away a bunch of business because Dr. Owner does things that you don't like (or can't) do.  I personally recommend you go to visit every clinic before you decide to accept work there - not only does it show general interest and involvement, you might find things that might influence your decision to work there or not (such as whether all the equipment is operational, or whether there's a hole in the ceiling that often allows dust to rain down into the room below).|What kind of unit do you have?

I don't see anything ""cagey"" about it, because the clinic is being upfront about what they're doing, and my guess is they've decided those are prospective clients that they are willing and able to lose, for reasons that you don't understand, which is also OK.   That's the owner's call to make.

You want your boss to be understanding of new grads, but if you don't connect well with that vet, there are other ways to find mentorship.   That vet say's he's willing to provide mentorship, but what he thinks of as ""mentorship"" and what you think of as ""mentorship"" might be two different things - you may not get what you want out of him, but that doesn't mean he's lying or misrepresenting himself.  

I recommend you don't work on any production based pay scheme, at least for the first year, because you simply don't know enough about the clinic or how it works to know how, let alone how much, you'll produce.   And I recommend you don't take a signing bonus -- it can become a real complicating tax issue if you don't stay (for one reason or another) and you're expected to pay it back.|> I won’t be able to unless I become at least a tech or a veterinarian

Don't think of veterinary technicians like that - the job of technicians is valuable, but it's also very different from that of a vet.  It's not ""lesser"", so there's no ""at least"" about it.  The first thing you should do is spend some time in a clinic (or several clinics, if you can) so you can see what the jobs of vets and techs are.   Don't even think about schooling until you know for sure it's what you want to do.|Yes, you'll probably be limited to volunteering occasionally.....You might be able to find weekend work at a local emergency clinic, doing cleaning or related jobs (that's often where people without experience start, doing what's known a ""kennel help"").|In general, I will say it definitely gets better, but I am in Canada and so don't have any UK perspective.

You can increase your chances of enjoying your career by setting personal and professional boundaries early, and finding a job and boss that respect those boundaries.......Boundaries such as refusing to accept being verbally abused by clients or managers, and refusing to let clients bully you into doing something you think is inappropriate or below the standard of care, for instance|>I was under the impression that we can terminate the relationship at anytime?

Probably not true, but it depends on your local regulations.   In many places, you can not fire a client while in the middle of treating their pet,  though sometimes there is a clause saying that you must give them enough time to find another vet to continue treatment.

And that's exactly why I think the admission expectations for vet school are all messed up.

They should value experience as waitstaff as highly as they value experience as kennel staff in a clinic (for instance).|Is the practice manager also a veterinarian?  If not, and if there are no standard protocols that have been instituted for particular situations, then: no.   They can suggest a vet what to use, but they can't tell a vet what they should do medically - that would be practising medicine without a license.  

A practise manager can ask a vet to use a certain drug (""we have this in stock, can you use it instead of X?"") or can refuse to make a certain drug available in the clinic (""we can't stock X because it's too expensive and isn't used often enough""), but that's not telling the vet what to do.|OK, it sounds like the PM might not have told the vet what they must use, but instead made a suggestion that they thought the vet should consider.   What language and tone the PM used is important here - if the PM said something like ""you should use this - Dr. Y had a similar case and it worked out well"", then it's a suggestion, and that's very different than ""that drug won't work, you should use this one instead"" which is directing the vet's treatment.

Did the vet think about it and use it instead because the vet thought the suggestion made sense, or did the vet use it instead because they felt they had to or they would face anger or discipline?  You probably don't know, but those are the things that determine if the PM was trying to practise medicine, or trying to make a helpful suggestion.|Then that was wrong - but it's on the vet as much - if not moreso - than the PM.|There's an AviMark help Facebook group - I've gotten some help from them before.|Have you heard of VetLife?

For the vast, vast majority of vets (those working in clinical medicine), this is a medical degree - we are doctors, but our patients happen to be animals rather than people.  Medical doctors don't go to med school and become doctors because they have a ""love and passion for people"".   In my opinion, a clinical vet needs a curiosity and interest in medicine/surgery primarily, and (in small animal medicine) a respect for and desire to support the human-animal bond between owners and pets.|A love of animals had nothing to do with it -- I was interested in medicine, and didn't want to be an MD.|Often at least 2 internships (i.e. 2 years) are required, because it's pretty competitive.....that might not be the case when the OP is graduating.|I haven't done it, but I suspect the change of pace and money would be a tough road (faster pace, less money).

The truth is you know more than you think you do, even though you don't know as much as you think you have to.......you don't have to.  You need to remember the basics::  Get a good history, do a good general physical exam, and never be afraid to look something up or ask a question of your fellow vets or techs/nurses.

You'll be fine.|>Mentorship! Prioritize mentorship when looking at places

But please know what ""mentorship"" means to you, because it doesn't mean the same thing to everyone.  If you want a ""mentee"" relationship with someone make sure you and they have the same expectations of what that means.

Personally, I think it's better to have a mentor that does not work where you do, especially not your boss - there's a real power dynamic there that can impede a good mentoring situation.|>and never felt the need for a power dynamic.

You misunderstand me if you think I said it's something you need.......Actually, it's something that exists, whether you want it or not, and I think it's something that isn't anything anyone wants in a mentoring situation.  

A vet can't escape that power dynamic in a mentoring situation within a clinic, but sometimes it's not healthy or not the best situation to mentor someone.  What if a mentee wants to deal with a medical situation in a way that is different from their boss, and doesn't know how to approach that situation?  What if one of the professional challenges they face is how to deal with a client who is also the boss' neighbour?  What if a mentee wants to discuss how to face the challenges of contract negotiation, or how to think about the future of their career and other job prospects?  What if they're worried about an ethical situation that they're not ready for their boss to know about?

Mentoring isn't training, and it isn't limited to delivering medical and surgical care.  There's no reason a mentor has to be in the same facility, because the real issues that need to be discussed aren't things that need to be discussed right then.  Training someone how to improve their speed in surgery isn't mentoring, and it's not mentoring to teach someone how to deal with a ruptured anal gland for the first time - mentoring is the big picture issue of discussing and encouraging someone how to solve those problems themselves|Are you a vet?

Yup - there's a surplus of vets out there now.  Your area might be in dire need of vets, but that's not because there aren't vets looking for jobs, it's because most vets are looking for jobs in suburban and urban areas (for various reasons).  Adding more vets won't suddenly make more people want to live in different parts of the country, or live different lifestyles.  

I agree that there's a problem of distribution of vets, not a problem in the number of vets.|>As someone who lives rural you absolutely can just not respond after hours. None of the vets here do.

That depends on where you practice -- in some places, vets have an obligation to respond after hours and they can be sanctioned if they don't.|>For example the dakotas, nevada, new mexico, wyoming, etc. dont have vet schools so the only people moving to those states to be vets are people who left them for vet school originally.

Don't for a second think you'll be avoiding ""crazy clients"", because you'd be exchanging them for ""crazy clients in grief"".  Don't do it because you think you'll be avoiding stress or needing to learn a bunch of stuff, because there's no such thing as a ""routine"" euthanasia any more than there is a ""routine"" ear infection or ""routine"" surgery.   It will create possibly more stress, not less stress, because it's every owner's worst day, and you have to be a bit of a counsellor as well as a vet.

What you're describing is based on your personal experience at one vet school in one specific time frame -- but you're advising other people (who may or may not be like you) about what their experience will be like at one of over 3 dozen vet schools at some unknown point in the future.  I say that as a vet who will happily tell anyone who asks that vet school sucked, but it was what I had to do in order to become a vet, and being a vet is way better than being a vet student.  

I didn't deal with a toxic environment, though I did deal with a few instructors who were a-holes.  That happens in any school or workplace.  That's especially true in an environment where sometimes there are literally lives on the line, and the instructors have to be sure they can fix whatever problems the students create.

Perfectionism is the bane and lifeblood of veterinary medicine, and I think it afflicts students more than it does the instructors (who know how to deal with errors and imperfection).  Perfectionism among vet students, and then vets, is an unfortunate byproduct of the selection system (IMO), and is the source of a lot of the mental health problems in the profession (IMO).

Of course there's no support for all species groups -- do you have any idea how many species that would be?  You're upset because you didn't get instruction on the unique and limited species you wanted to learn about, but that disappointment is on you:  You should have - and could have - know about that before you went to vet school.  All you would have had to do was peruse the courses and ask a few questions on forums like this (or StudentDoctorNetwork) to know that ""niche"" species and areas of interest are really not covered in undergrad vet school.  It takes post grad and extra curricular classes to get to those parts of veterinary medicine.  

That ""you're not a real doctor"" situation you're facing sucks, but it's a reality of the profession and something you definitely could have known about because it's not new.  It's been that way for 50 years, and happens even to specialists.   You've obviously spent time shadowing or working with vets, and you've obviously spent at least a decade being around people and seeing/hearing how they think about vets - didn't you ever see that before?   Anyone who becomes a vet expecting prestige or money has made a mistake, and it's unfortunate that anyone goes into the profession with those ideas (it's one of the first things I tell people about the profession, along with the reality that vets spend most of their time with people, not animals).   I'm sorry if you've made that mistake.  

Taking paperwork (or computer work) home is NOT common for most practitioners - and in some places isn't even allowed.  The only vets I know who do that occasionally are owners, and they don't get it done at work because they also have management stuff to do.  There certainly are practitioners that have to do that, but that's specific to that clinic and it's not common.  Are students used as free labour?  Of course - just like in most other professional schools, but that's 4 years compared with a career of 25-40 years.  

You've got weird expectations about what privileges a ""professional degree"" should get you......Of course doctors (like many other professionals) work weekends in some jobs - that's because illness and injury doesn't care whether it's a weekday or weekend.  What did you expect?  Not all jobs in veterinary medicine involve clinic work, and not all clinics are open weekends, but those that aren't open weekends are able to do that because of the availability of doctors who DO work weekends in after-hours and ER clinics in many locations.  They have professional degrees too, and I am thankful that they're not too proud of their ""professional degree"" to work weekends.  

I'm sorry you're dissatisfied with your career choice, but I think it's a good profession that has both good and bad jobs (just like any profession).  I think a lot of your dissatisfaction is personal (based on your preconceived notions and unrealistic expectations), and not broadly about vet school (which sucked) or veterinary medicine as a profession.  I expected vet school to suck, and it did, but I am so much happier being a vet.|Canada.  Midline.|I'm sorry for the loss of your patient.

If this was a situation of previous management who's hit a tough spot, I can see reason to hang on and help them through it, back to the way things were, but.....Since this is new management who want to run things a new way, you should feel free to leave if you don't like the way they run things.|Vetgirl on the Run|I've only ever seen autoligation used in cat neuters, but I'm sure some vets somewhere are doing it.

Remember, there's no such thing as a routine surgery, even spays and neuters, so 1 technique does not fit all.  Especially when it comes to things like ""big"" or ""small"" dogs -- what's important is the size of their reproductive organs, not the size of the patient, and they don't always work in tandem.

Midline incision for cat and dog spays, pre-scrotal for dog neuters, scrotal for cat neuters.  Monocryl for all sutures, unless there's a lot of fat, then I use a braided for those ligations.  Modified miller's knots for spays and dog neuters (1 or 2), and subcuticular closures.  Usually put a ligature on the tunic on older or larger dogs, as it can get quite muscular and bleed a bit.  Occasionally transfix spays, depending on the size.|Everything is negotiable, and there is no ""normal"" - some pay the same percentage on everything that isn't included, some pay different percentages on different things.

&#x200B;

>I want to know how much of a windfall my employer has made

You also negotiated that salary.  Don't pretend that your employer is the only person to blame for a salary you don't like.  And don't forget that your employer almost assuredly spent more than that salary on you - they spent a lot of additional time with a new grad.

New grads should be thinking about so many other things than money, everything from medical cases to surgical techniques to client communication.  The learning curve is steep getting out of school, and there's no need or benefit to making it a steeper curve.   Additionally, new grads have no way to gauge their ability to make money in the clinic, because they don't know the effect of all those variables that are at play.  What's more, they shouldn't have to - they should be spending their time and brain power on learning to be a better clinician.  

I'm against production-based pay in general, but I'm particularly against it for new grads, for at least the first 6-12 months.|>I'm sorry if you can't comprehend that a person can simultaneously focus on improving at their job while also calculating how much their effort is worth to their employer.

I can comprehend it, but I think it's wrong and wrongheaded.  I know vets that do it, and I think they're spending their time and mental energy on the wrong things at that stage of their career.  

Of course you should fight for a fair salary, and I think it's not wrong to know how much gross income you earned the clinic in your first year *in order to assess how your year went* (your boss will do the same), but assessing your contributions for the  year is different than worrying about production ahead of time, or (worse) while you're working.|I agree that it seems odd that it developed so far from surgery, and it makes me wonder about the dog's healing or clotting.  Or if there was other trauma.

There are valid safety and security concerns to having cameras (with or without audio) in a vet clinic - not just where money and drugs are being handled, but also in the exam room where clients might do something illegal (whether it's assault, threaten, or try to blackmail you).

That being said, I would not tolerate someone using that video to critique my performance or micro-manage my cases.  If a boss was going to use recordings for that purpose, I'd be finding a new job with a boss who has a different attitude about practice and privacy.|It's not really being recorded for training purposes......that's just what they say so that they don't have to say ""This call is being recorded so that we will have proof if you verbally abuse our employees"".|Why are you looking for a post-grad program?

Ask her why she/they are not using the EMR feature in Cornerstone.  

There's nothing magical about EMR vs. hand written records - the devil is in the details.  Some people may find one method faster than the other, depending on their familiarity with the software and their keyboarding speed.  Typed records will be more legible, but it's possible to have fast and legible hand written records.  A bad electronic record is no better than a bad hand written record, and being able to read to see how bad (lacking) it is won't make it any better.

The second thing is that this is a medical degree and career, and you have to be interested in medicine, in not also science.

I am absolutely dying to know how I did, but I likely won't post on social media for at least a few days. However, if I fail, I will not be posting anything and will be running into traffic instead :)))))|I was just having a conversation with one of my friends last night regarding this. I felt anxious leading up to NAVLE, sure, but not at this level. I pick at my cuticles and that had been managed prior, but the past month has been terrible, both on my nerves and cuticles!|Bro, this is truly the weirdest hobby. Get a life, my guy|In undergrad, I had a professor who was a veterinarian. On day one, she told the class to call her Dr. First Name and to ALWAYS refer to doctors as Dr. First/Last Name, until they told us otherwise, particularly female-presenting doctors, since they've often had to work twice as hard as their male-presenting counterparts to be respected. That's always stuck with me, and unless I'm referring to one of my own direct classmates, every doctor I meet is Dr. First/Last Name. It's a sign of respect, not only of the title, but also of all the blood, sweat, and tears we've put in to be where we are."

captSNAX,"For what it’s worth, I’ve had 13 years of experience with Banfield from the other side of the counter and their care and service has had a noticeable decline over the last few years. Enough so that we only took our dog there for routine bloodwork and vaccines because they were included in a care plan that couldn’t be canceled. The last surgery experience was a total nightmare that started with them not having the sedative to put her under on the date of surgery and ended with a tech bringing my 13 yo dog out while still POURING blood from the incision sites and sutures already coming untied. This required no less than 6 follow-ups for post-op care.  My wife was a vet tech for years and I am in biology research, so we kind of knew what red flags to look for. We notice a lot that were similar to what you are describing. That being said, I understand your position. I’m not sure how your field looks at previous practice reputation, but if that is a factor, then I wouldn’t want my name attached to that company. Sterility issues are a big deal and an indicator of attention to detail. Personally, I would hold out for VCA (have had some positive experiences with them) or look for alternatives. Maybe a smaller practice in your area. But I understand the need to acquire experience, so if you do go with Banfield I would keep expectations low and keep an eye out for better opportunities. Best of luck!"

mostlylighthearted,"I’m intrigued by these comments because I rarely use first names with doctors (my current practice I use their last name). I’m often curious about this topic and even asked a friend whose a human MD and she told me she doesn’t care whether hospital staff use her first name. I’d like to be able to freely use first names without feeling judged, I think it’s a good way to build workplace camaraderie. A couple of the dvms I work with don’t mind it but overall we use last name. 

The weirdest part for me is the doctors will use first names with each other and not the technicians. Like one dr. I work with told my new grad friend to call her by her first name but she wants technicians to call her dr so-and-so|I’ll add to exercise with work: take the stairs when you can!|I got a near 20% raise when our clinic went corporate.

I’m curious from a dvm standpoint (and if you’re willing to expand), what about your corporate experience influenced your ability to provide quality medicine?|I’m an LVT. I work in a HCOL area and paid relatively well. Benefits overall are more expansive. For what I personally use it doesn’t necessarily net out better.

Kindly-Metal-6421,"I agree with a lot of things you have mentioned, and most days I am staying unpaid overtime to follow a case, the boss isn’t always there to see,
I was also told to take only vaccine appointments at the beginning and I pushed myself way over my comfort zone and I am taking much more complicated ones. 
I did decline my day off to come in, for the main reason that it was after a full weekend first on call, where I had to come in multiple times and figure out what to do, if I was experienced it wouldnt take as much energy but being entirely new and overthinking everything takes huge energy alone, and that’s why I do need my days off to recover. 
My concern was mainly him overreacting and blaming me for reputation which I never messed with, I found it a bit unreasonable to expect a grad to do invasive surgeries in the first month. 
His job is to teach me and mentor me, he is paying me graduate salary and should expect me to learn and build a foundation with good skills not rushed in and overworked just so I can say I did it in few weeks. 
Otherwise I agree, I do have to put in more work than the others at the start. But I do need more time to recover and reflect. |Hello! I am a vet graduate from an EU university, I had Canadian and American colleagues in the university with me. Make sure you apply for EAEVE accredited schools, it doesn’t matter which tbh, after that if you want to work in the US or Canada, you have to sit the NAVLE, that’s pretty much it. If you want to work in the UK, you only need to apply for equivalence with RCVS, no statutory exam required, I personally did that in less than 1 month. I personally don’t understand why anyone would be willing to have this amount of debt that might go on for years and add to the chances of burn out, there are alternatives. The schools are not free of course, and they are 6 year programs usually (some 5.5years) so if you have an undergraduate you might be able to exempt a few course maybe but you will probably need to start and do full years. Feel free to PM if you have more questions. Take care!|That’s correct, I mentioned that EAEVE accreditation does not qualify you to work as a vet in US or Canada but if the university is listed, you are allowed to do the NAVLE (there are few steps before) and yes they do cost quite a few thousands, but I think it’s reasonable to do that as opposed to stacking up tens of thousands in student loans. Just my personal opinion."

JurassicKitty,"This is actually really helpful. I was thinking the same recently after seeing some posts commenting on what current new grad salaries are... I had no idea the starting salaries had gotten so high. Everyone deserves to get paid fairly for our time and skills, but it is hard to know what's ""competitive"" when salaries appear to be changing rapidly from year to year and vary so much with COL. I definitely need to renegotiate with my clinic to reflect my experience and this info would be very helpful to have. Nice site"
Servisium,"This isn't not trusting you, this is bullying.

I would say it's normal for techs to watch a new grad a little closer because we know they're likely overwhelmed and stressed and may miss things like a piece of gauze in surgery, make a rounding error, or mix up a drug but no one should go about it in a way that makes you feel stupid or inadequate. It's ultimately supposed to be a supportive environment where everyone is helping everyone."

That being said, I've had 20 years to see who does and who doesn't lose their vet license. It takes a lot.

In terms of being sued, those egregious cases are newsworthy because they are rare. I have to believe that most people are reasonable.  If I didn't, I wouldn't be able to live in this society.|This is the comment I've been looking for.|This is good advice! Relief work is a great way to try out a practice before you commit. And if you do like them, most likely they are hiring!|Many years ago, a wise old vet said to me,  ""I just tell them, 'You can pay me now or you can pay me later, but later will cost more.'"" Meaning, I know what you will have to do to fix this. Do you want to trust me and do it now, or come back when foofoo dust doesn't work and the condition is 10x worse?

If the answer is, ""I don't know,"" then speak to the manager and find out.

If the answer is, ""No one,"" speak to the manager and tell them you need a trainer.

If the answer is, ""Everyone,"" that's the same as no one. Everyone's job is no one's job.

If the answer is a specific person or couple of people, these are the people you should be asking when you don't know what to do.

I'm a senior doctor, and I frequently see this with inexperienced, newly hired support staff. They come to me for training for very basic things because I'm the person in charge. However, I have a lot of responsibilities, including training newly grad doctors. I work about 60 hours a week. There are two RVTs who have been assigned to train them. They are the people to ask. I do not provide OTJ training to newly hired assistants. If I did, I would never go home. 

This is my perspective. If you want to continue this job, when you are asked to do something you don't know how to do, ask your trainer. The doctors are busy doctoring. They are not here to nurture your soul.|This is dictated by your contract and, like everything in your contract, is potentially negotiable.|This is my reason, too|Yikes. A lot of these responses seem to be missing the point. These cameras are being put in exam rooms, not for security, but expressly to micromanage OP's exams. That can be incredibly intimidating,  especially for someone who is self-conscious or camera shy. For some people, it could actually cause them to perform worse because they are constantly thinking about management hanging over their shoulder.

I think the best way to get on top of it would be to meet with management and to ask them what is triggering this change and what their specific performance concerns are. If they have specific concerns and they seem to be legitimate [e.g., clients' complaints about communication (legit) vs. you aren't selling enough wellness plans (gimme a break,)] propose an alternative. If they say they don't have any concerns, they are just 'looking for ways to improve,' tell them you have concerns about it adversely affecting your performance. If they won't listen, find a job that will listen to you."

Naamch3,"Imposter syndrome sure seems to hit a greater # of people in this recent crop of college grads. I wonder why? But for your purposes please don’t let it stop you. Most others in a range of graduating years near you had the Covid impact as well. I have two suggestions. #1 pursue your dream vet job and let nothing stop you…especially yourself. You will grow old regretting it. Knowing you gave up on your dream b/c you lacked confidence will gnaw at you forever and could destroy your mental health over time. Once you get your vet job and are treating patients I doubt the vet practice will allow you to be a sole decision maker on critical cases at first. You and they will want to have an experienced voice in both diagnosis then treatment. Also, be open during your interview. Let them know how much you want the job and ask about mentorship.  Like any medical position a credible veterinary practice will want to assess you before they allow you to fly solo. It might help if you interview at larger practices where they might have more mentoring options. Be upfront about your nervousness. They will appreciate it and tell you that it is normal. If you get an offer from a veterinary practice that doesn’t give you the confidence that there will be mentorship as well as various checks to ensure you cause no outlandish harm then just keep interviewing. Please don’t let that voice in your head cause you to take a desk job and god forbid you take a government job. That sounds like a recipe for a lifetime of regret and pain. I don’t know you but I assume you are better than a government job.

Option #2, if you really are paralyzed by your imposter syndrome then what about interviewing for nurse or technician jobs at vet practices? Or vet / doctor assistant? I apologize for not knowing the right vocabulary for these positions. Sure the pay won’t be what you could make as a veterinary doctor but it provides for a slower start and a longer runway to get your feet under you. As for the economics, assuming the ‘nurse’ job builds you into having the confidence to flip to veterinary doctor then the lifetime earnings will far exceed the giving up option of pursuing that banal government desk job.

Hope this was helpful. A rule of thumb I often use is this, you have only two people in this world to make proud of you. Those two people are your eight year old self and your eighty year old self. Keep them in mind as you choose between pursuing the veterinary career you’ve trained and worked hard for versus the government desk job option."

Upbeat_Intention2843,"Weirdest question on pre paying for vet school.

Weird question on how I can finance school.  Ross did me dirty and I want to return to vet school. My best option is the Caribbean (SNU/SMU) but that means paying out of pocket as they aren’t able to receive FAFSA.
I can’t get private loans because these schools aren’t American. Personal loans are only 20k at a time and subjective to credit. Maybe credit cards? I’m justrying to figure this out. I can’t be the first one to have this problem. How did you guys do it? 

Please don’t advise me to give up. I have my in-laws for that. I have 50k equity in a house and 50k in savings. 

 How should I finance the 50-100k rest? Any advice would be appreciated."

You might consider manually setting up your firewall, or migrating to a node on the cloud.

AWS offers a free linux server that you can run the node on, that's what i've been doing so I don't compromise my home network, if you get into that problem with the server just stop the instance and restart to get a brand new IP!

It's not always a matter of volume, sometimes you need to prioritize efficiency when it comes to grades because there's so much to do and little time|It's a better idea to actually experience vet school before deciding on these things. Before vet school I hated cardiac physiology, never really understood it and just sort of assumed I'd go into surgery because I'm good with my hands. I'm currently in vet school and I fell in love with cardiology, hematology, oncology... Surgery is literally my least favorite subject. I'm definitely going to be pursuing internal medicine as a specialty, and I would never have imagined myself doing so before actually taking the classes. Be patient, and explore before you commit to anything, and remember you don't necessarily have to commit to anything at all! You can be a GP and that's great as well."

Which-Dragonfly1265,"I'm glad to see colleagues who have an interest in this and think it is an important issue. Obviously it is complex issue and individuals/groups that have a financial stake in it often don't have the best interests of our professions at heart. Here are some other thoughts I have on the matter that I didn't elaborate on above.

1. We are a small profession. That means our educational institutions don't have the luxury to just produce veterinarians. That is, of course, the primary goal but quality institutions also support significant research activities to advance the state of medicine, train interns/residents/graduate students, perform outreach activities, etc. None of these new schools do this to a significant degree which hurts our profession. If a vet school popped up at Columbia or Harvard, I suppose it would be a different issue.
2. At some point, the expansion will lead us down the route of the legal profession. Tons of schools with only the graduates of ""top tier"" schools able to find employment out of schools as well as internships or residencies. Human medicine is somewhat insulated from this as the number of practicing physicians is limited by the number of residency positions NOT the number of graduating physicians/medical schools. I DO realize that a pedigree can help get a human residency but it is a different playing field. I don't know how dentistry is fairing due to this phenomenon. Are there too many dental schools?
3. The profession can largely blame the AVMA and COE for this situation. The first distributive was initially denied accreditation and in response, sued the AVMA. Mark Cushing was a part of that. The AVMA caved. Let me be clear, there are positives to the distributive model and if the institution also prioritizes research, training, etc, then they can be an asset. University of Calgary is a great example of this. University of Arizona could be one as well but they have their own problems (namely poor NAVLE scores).
4. Debt - Private schools that have distributive models don't try to reduce costs by not having a teaching hospital. They just charge the student market rates. This is criminal. Teaching hospitals are a MAJOR expense to a school. Do these new schools paying the offsite rotation hospitals an equivalent amount to running a teaching hospital annually? I doubt it. This is just compounding the problem of debt for our students.
5. Like many have commented, the goal of training DVMs to fill rural positions is ludicrous. This is a ploy parroted by the new programs to use as justification. Unless rural position provide incentive with higher salaries or loan repayment, solving rural shortage by producing more DVMs is not going to work.

What can we do about it? I don't know. There is a lot of money involved and key players in academic leadership (deans) and the AVMA stand to benefit from moving into the private sector and helping groups like the animal policy group. So they don't rock the boat. There is no money to be made for apposing it and no ones got time to do it. It has to be out of passion and love for our profession. But here are some thoughts.

1. Discussions amongst interest groups. Things like discussions on VIN, local and state VMAs, speciality colleges, conferences, etc. But there is also something to be said about having this issue blow up on social media, which is why the younger generation of DVMs is so important. I'm old and not social media savvy. Getting a post to reddit was difficult for me. But I've seen the power of ""not one more vet"" (NOMV). Maybe something like that could help.
2. Getting involved and being vocal. This can be with state VMAs, the AVMA, etc. Getting involved in the COE. Writing letters to editor for JAVMA.

Any other ideas?"
KarlTheVeg,"House officers but no house (hospital)?|I’ve wanted to be a veterinarian since I was 5. Now, here I am. Most days I regret my career choice. My imposter syndrome is unmanaged and often crippling. I’ve been out 5 years now. After internship and residency, I now have the job I dreamed of in school. I still go to work because I have to. My debt is average. I often wish I’d become an airline pilot, a lawyer, or a civil engineer/urban planner. This isn’t to scare you or do affect your decision in any way. I just wanted to offer some truthful commentary from someone who’s lived through it and now lives with regret. Good luck. |It’s a tough spot to be in. I’ve been there. I am there. I meet with a therapist every now and then. It helps temporarily but the feelings soon return. I’m envious of my colleagues who appear not to care or who seem not to be affected by errors/mistakes. I wish you the best!|There’s a shortage of radiologists out there. If you could get and finish a residency you could work/read from home. It would take a 3 year investment but would probably be worth it. If I could do it again that’s what I would’ve done. Good luck! |I didn’t say it wasn’t an easy process. The demand for DACVR specialists exceeds the current supply provided by the available training programs. "

Sakitwee,"I would also be willing to claim some from you.|What are the best websites to study USA in practice laws and which department controls what - for example for turtles?|Yes thank you so much! Also the post you made, tysm helped me regain my sanity to battle this out again but for Nov-Dec of this year :)|I don’t think it’s wrong to know that you passed a second time with extra time. I think it takes a better person to accept that they need the extra time to succeed than someone who is prideful that they don’t need the time when they really should. In the end no one is ever going to ask you how many times you took the NAVLE and what score you got.

I already graduated and if I don’t pass I will have to take it a 4th time. It is demoralizing especially since I did well in school. But I know I shouldn’t have taken it the 2nd time when I was so burnout on rotations. 

So don’t let it bother you so much you didn’t pass the first time. The test isn’t a great way to show we are competent vets. It’s made to be hard and mentally taxing. (Though for what reason I’m not sure). 

But never give up and never look down on yourself.|https://www.vin.com/ce/MULT205-0124.htm|Have u tried doing volunteer preceptorship observational work at either? Might give u a good idea of how the work environment is.

For me I chose to be a vet over MD because I love animals so much more. But it is super unfortunate that the salary for vets is so low. The vet salary really doesn't increase unless u specialize as a vet dentist or something and then get 250k+ but that's another 4 years of work.

My friend is an MD, and he doesn't think its worth it either. He's a family doctor and its really taxing to give people advice and they don't follow it and they are still mad at you. But he does make wayyyy more money so I guess that is a plus.

It pretty much weighs on you if you are capable with the lower wage and stressful conditions but love animals or if a higher wage and more annoying human clients to deal with.

Idk if this helped you but my best advice is to try volunteer observational work in both fields before you fully decide.|Are you picky where you want to go? Or do you simply want to be a vet no matter what? I think the caribbean schools that are in the association are a good backup if you want to get in no matter what. At the end of the day, the client isn't going to care what school you went to, just if you know your stuff and if you are nice. You could also apply to overseas schools, I went to the Royal Veterinary College (super good school) and if finances are an issue, I was able to get full federal loans for tuition and accommodation as an independent with no parent help.  So it is possible to be a vet, it just depends on how picky or the want to be a vet. My gpa was a 3.2 because it lowered my last 2 years of college from commuting.|Any suggestions should I do both Zuku and Vetprep questions? If I fail this I will have to take it a 3rd time.|If they can fuck up like this, how can we trust them that they don't fuck up checking the exam answers and scoring us all? ? ?| I think worrying about my results has shaved off at least 10 years of my life.|Omg I came to this chat to see if anyone else got the email and now I’m freaking out and haven’t checked yet|I think they want my money for the THIRD TIME NOW FML|Probably postponed for another day lol|Well I will at least file the complaint. We should at least band together and do so. So it's not just swept under the rug.|Plus it doesn’t matter if you think based on people you see study or not. There are plenty of people who have studied a lot and have done well in school and still have not passed the exam.|I’m in the exact same position as you. Overseas school that graduated in 2023 and had to take it again and moved back to the U.S. I know it is a lot of pressure on us to pass this exam, but best to still keep positive no matter the outcome. (I say this but I kept having mental breakdowns the last few weeks waiting for these results 😅)|pls no im on my 3rd try ;-;|Omg I don't want to have to retake the exam because they fucked up what even|omg i had that exact question!|yeah u do have enough time, but doesn't mean the later dates are available its a bit iffy|Same I want to join too|Or Atleast I’m going to contest them when I get my score back and it shows I didn’t pass.

And then might drag them to court. Because it is a ridiculous exam to begin with and is far more ridiculous on how they are dealing with it now.|You're clearly not important enough|Guys please, Im currently on my period so its gonna hit harder than ever these results and Im going to be so upset if I'm so close and didn't pass. I took it for a 2nd time and I already graduated. I feel like a waste of space at this rate.|I’ve gotten no email from IVCA yet, usually they email you that they are released.|I want to pass I really do, I studied so hard, but also super anxious that I did fail. And then what am I going to do then?|I’m a recent graduate and I did the GAB year but I got into it with a 3.2 gpa. I think the 5 year program isn’t bad either it gives your mind a little bit more breathe room so I wouldn’t feel ashamed in doing that.|Lol same I’m not from the usa and failed the first time. But taking it again in 5 days. But I remember the first time taking it I was just so nervous the first 2 hrs in the exam my brain was not braining.|Honestly I think this is the best advice. Pretty much just believe in yourself. I too am taking it again after graduating from a school outside the usa, and the biggest thing I just struggled with the first time was not taking practice questions to see how the exam is like and being so nervous the first 2 hrs in the exam. Even if ur score is the lower end on the practice, I think the test questions are easier."

RedundantMarsupial,"Hi! Not a vet, but have worked in both commercial and teaching farms for vet schools, small animal GP, and research models, which all required euthanasia in some capacity.

As for facing it throughout your veterinary career: it depends what you want to go into. During vet school, you will do euthanasias, learn about them, etc. If you plan on going into small animal, sedation before pushing euthanasia solution is common for a “traditional death”. If you love food animal/population medicine, it is quite different from euthanasia in GP. Even on teaching farms we use euthanasia solution but I have never euthanized this way in a commercial unit. If this is what you want to do, it may be hard to cope with euths. 

Coming from someone who used to cry and faint when I had to collect tissue samples from mice, let alone euthanize them, you do get a bit desensitized, to be frank. I call it exposure therapy, but the more you see the better it will sit with you. Most vet schools (at least that I’ve known) also have therapists and outreach for students/staff, which may be beneficial to you.

Sorry for such a long post, but I resonated a lot with how you felt. Good luck with your applications and your last semester of undergrad :)"

Also, you only pay interest on the amount you have taken out of your line or credit, so it would be smaller interest payments in first year and be bigger in 4th year.

Professional_Map612,Not sure about any of the details of being an optometrist and not sure what the pay is like but I highly recommend keeping vet pay in mind. The field isn’t paid the best not sure what pay range is like in Australia but the US pay is not that good I’ve seen a lot leave the field. Many assistants and techs alone are leaving the field not quite sure about doctors but from some threads I’ve seen on here a lot are also struggling.

iniminimum,"This is not meant to come across as rude, but most new doctors come in and are too big tmfor their britches. 


If they are disrespecting you there is probably a reason.


Instead of just bossing the techs around, try talking to them, and work through problems with them.

There is nothing worse than a fresh doctor who comes in and starts bossing techs around without learning the flow ofnthe hospital.

I've been a cvt for 13 years in ecc/icu and oncology , and have worked with many intern docs, and have worked with many who think they know everything/they know best, and those doctors tend to get the cold shoulder .

33554432,"I'm at Penn, I think it's a mixed bag. 

Cons: the curriculum I'm on is being phased out and a new one is coming in, so it's very much in a transitory state. Seems like the new curriculum is good and is getting people more hands on experience? Hands on experience rn is in the cons column for me, it mostly falls on me to pursue opportunities outside of class. Also my big complaint is disorganization and communication. It often feels like no one is ""driving the car"" and there are just too many siloed services that don't talk to each other or to us lol. Also I do not like Philly that much (expensive and I'm not a city guy) and the split campus thing sucks if you're large animal focused (large animal hospital is an hour outside the city). Oh also we lost our exotics service during the pandemic.

Pros: High quality of professors (sometimes a bad thing bc a person teaching you is too educated to see where common blind spots might be), a lot of them are very good at teaching. Good case load for certain things (shelter med and small animal stuff in general, small animal specialty, standardbred race horses, high level show horses, dairy and pork to some extent). Scholarship availability seems to be halfway decent here too, maybe better than at a public institution? Also I think the abuse students receive here is less than at other schools? Idk reading some other threads here I suddenly feel like I have it good, very few people have given me a shitty attitude. And the gossip suggests that the really egregious cases actually get addressed. I also feel like the education has made me super prepared for the NAVLE but I'm also a tryhard who studies too much. 

Idk that I would recommend it (maybe if you really like the city and you're small animal focused with an eye for residency) and if I got a do-over idk that I would go here again for sure (I had a comparable offer elsewhere), but I feel very confident that it could be worse, I don't super hate it here, and I'm getting a pretty solid education at least in the theoretical parts.|I'm at Penn, I think it's a mixed bag.

Present-Diamond7994,"I am licensed in Korea and in USA.

In Korea, you go straight to vet school after high school and you spend 6 years at the vet school to become a vet (GP). And the degree is not a doctorate. In USA, you have to go to college and complete prerequisite courses first in order to be able to apply for the vet school. College undergrad degree is not required but many students get bachelor’s degree before going into vet school. Once you graduate from the vet school, you are a doctor (the degree is called Doctorate of Veterinary Medicine). 

I am Korean but studies in the states. I did not pursue specialty, and I still get paid pretty well (working 30h per week; 180k base + production; 100k sign-on bonus for 2y agreement). I am not looking to open my own practice just yet."

Emilyredwine,"I’ve been out 14 years and I do think that your time off should be yours. 

However, I knew nothing when I graduated from vet school and I wasn’t even aware of how little I knew, but I did do an internship and residency and spent four extra years giving up my time off to learn. 

I still stay up night desperately researching cases, but much more of my time off is protected now.

I think you have to find a balance. It isn’t wrong to set boundaries, but especially as a new grad you have to recognize that your growth will be hampered by you not taking the extra time to learn. You will eventually get where you want to be, but more slowly. And you may make mistakes along the way.

I think you should have a frank discussion with your boss about how to achieve your goal of improving and also protecting your time off as much as possible. If they aren’t willing to work with you, there are lots of practices who will.

Weak-Chicken-353,"Pay for veterinary school without a loan? Yeah you could definitely do that… if you’re extremely wealthy.|A fourth year at another school (remaining anonymous because the Vet world is rather small) here. I have had similar experiences for my rotations and have heard stories from other colleagues on their rotations. I can’t tell if dealing with veterinarians/technicians like what you’re describing is just the demeanor of those working in academia/teaching hospitals or if that is literally just how coworkers are going to be everywhere. I think part of it is just the environment of what teaching hospitals are. It’s a lot of egos and brilliant people (both techs and DVMs) who have their opinions of medicine and their peers. I personally am a “head down, don’t participate in the gossip and politics, then you can leave” type of student. But in doing so, I see and hear a lot of what residents, clinicians, and colleagues say about each other. It’s pretty harsh honestly. I hope your experience gets better, as it’s already tough enough, but honestly, it sounds like what you’re experiencing is a common problem.|Pay for veterinary school without a loan? Yeah you could definitely do that… if you’re extremely wealthy.|The exam fee is certainly normal (area dependent) in my opinion. Clients often comment on increasing costs in general, but the quality and standards of care have increased as well over the years. Not only that, but drug manufacturers and retailers are increasing their costs as well. If I am not charging according to their increasing costs, I won’t be in business much longer to sell said products. Times are changing, care is changing, and costs are increasing with them. 

As for the cremation process, I don’t have much of an opinion on that. It sounds as if that would be something that the client should take up with the crematorium. 

“Is your vet shitty” is also a bit subjective. Based on the reason you gave in your post, I would hesitate to say that’s the case. But, I have noticed a trend with client perception of care quality and corporate ownership. Some clients are tough to deal with, some veterinarians may not take as much pride in quality care as others, and some circumstances have a lot of moving parts.|Not necessarily. I have seen numerous offers that include production without negative accruals. I do agree though. Our goal as practitioners should be to practice sound medicine. I hate the idea of getting paid in a manner that inherently promotes seeing as many patients as possible and selling as many services as possible."
FXRCowgirl,"There is a shortage of large animal/farm animal vets.  

The ones out in practice are close to retirement and over worked.  Others don’t do farm calls as there is not associate to help run the clinic if a doctor steps out.  

Emergency medicine for large animals is even worse.  After hours you have to haul an hour or more to get to a teaching hospital(vet school) or a very large facility that has an overnight team.|You bet. The only thing regulated in the vet industry is insuring vets have a license.  A few states require techs to be licensed but for the most part, assistances and techs have no requirement for education or experience.|No! I did not!!!!"

thetapetumlucidum,"Something similar happened to me once. I applied for and was hired for overnight emergency (which I had years of experience in) in a specialty hospital. I ended up spending MONTHS doing day shifts in the sterilizing department “for training purposes” instead. Turns out they weren’t that busy in the evenings and really only needed “emergency” staff to monitor post op patients, but someone had just left the sterilizing job and their cash cow was their surgical department. I left after six months. There was no point in fighting them or waiting it out.

i’m currently a senior in high school, and i’m interested in pursuing veterinary medicine as a career.

i was recently accepted to university, but there is no “pre-vet” track, so i was wondering what coursework and experience is required to apply to vet programs in the US. is there any specific exams i need to take? 

if anyone has tips or advice on how i can plan out my next four years that would be really appreciated and awesome 😊🐾

justforyouTM,"I have 50000 to 60000 udp change it in settings and router. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/137fcnb/new_to_this_i_just_wanna_have_reassurance_and/jixryxz/ | If you go to the website where u can view the nice status and all. There are settings which u can adjust accordingly.

U could be connected with upnp which is normal, but I would recommend switching that and manually forward you router firewall rules. (Ports 50000,60000) in this case. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/137fcnb/new_to_this_i_just_wanna_have_reassurance_and/jj2hrah/ | What do you mean its not recognize port interval?

Depending on your router you can specify a port range usually something like 50000-60000 will work but sometimes it uses a ~ or some other. check your model for that info.

Probably not all traffic. But check that on site. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/137fcnb/new_to_this_i_just_wanna_have_reassurance_and/jj2kvpv/ | To my knowledge there is no limit, only thing is the bandwidth limit I guess. 
I never had any more than 4 or 5 simultaneous connections.
2 are on 24/7. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/1317gkr/what_is_the_limit_of_simultaneous_connections_in/ji0zj6s/ | here is my ongoing connection from the us.

so i would say that this is not normal behavior. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/vtsdpi/000135/ig55ksg/ | I have docker running windows, and everything works fine. Just go to your local UI. Port 4449 or something. There you can adjust things like the UDP port range to use. And you can open up those ports if UPNP did not already ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/ulm6v5/newbie_configuration_doubts/i7wd4b1/ | i changed my UDP ports range to 33000:60000 and open it in the router.

did you solve it by now? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/ulm6v5/newbie_configuration_doubts/i9jp9m5/ | Hahaha there he is. Commenting on my other posts. Yeah horrible opsec huh. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/ulm6v5/newbie_configuration_doubts/ia1kdgy/ | Yeah because you gonna hack me right. Already did a other smaller range. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/ulm6v5/newbie_configuration_doubts/ia1kj39/ | Hahaha u crack me up. have a nice day. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/ulm6v5/newbie_configuration_doubts/ia1rus4/"

Naiylah,"I agree and disagree. 

While my internship was exhausting and underpaid, the mentorship and experience I obtained has been critical to my success. Some of the Dvms were “bad eggs” but not most. I did a private practice internship.

My residency (in academia) was a supportive and nurturing environment with amazing mentorship. Very underpaid. 

But I do agree- the lack of oversight has lead to many abusive programs.

I also have concerns about the numbers of residency programs (in both academia and private practice ) that require extensive non competes or agreements to work for the group for xxxyears. This seems predatory.

I do find fewer and fewer vet students come thru with plans for internships nowadays, and find many 4th year students to be woefully unprepared for clinical practice."
shortchic88,"Hi there, unfortunately this field is very discouraging when it comes to pay. Average tech life is 5-7 years because of many reasons but pay is a leading reason. We do it because we love it not for pay.

Background: I've been in the field for 20 years, started as kennel and moved up to room nurse in GP.  Switched to ER about 4 years in and became a tech. Love ER and became lead tech then tech manager then practice manager of 24 hr ER and specialty clinic. I started going to tech school but as I was advancing I made more without the degree (live in Texas where it's not currently required). Externships are hard to get especially working 80hr weeks in the industry shortage. I came to learn that it's your ethic and the people you know. 

GP I was making $7.55/ hr in 2007 vs. ER started at $18/hr plus shift differential. Ended at $33/ hr as management and was hiring techs at $22-$28 based on experience not degree- what I have seen in the field a degree didn't mean much since I run circles around green techs with degrees. Not saying anything against it either.

Currently I manage an academy and make $85k which requires a bachelor's degree but once interviewed I was perfect for the job and they didn't require it- also was recommended which is why I really hang on it's all about who you know.|Hi there, unfortunately this field is very discouraging when it comes to pay.

OhBlackWater,"Before serious consideration of applying to veterinary school: you need to work or at least volunteer at an animal hospital to get a better appreciation of the work and day-to-day life of a veterinarian. 

Aside from getting a better understanding, a competitive applicant has many hours (myself 10,000+ when i was admitted but I'm not a normal applicant) experience under the supervision of a veterinarian.|I will say that's a satisfying bandage"

Hobywony,"I'm not a Vet, but rather a retired (after 45 years) Clinical Laboratory Technologist who about 35 years in accompanied my wife to the ER for a possible lower limb embolus and PE.

After a bit her assigned nurse returns and I asked if she minded if I had a try after explaining my job and experience (in the hospitals where I worked I was frequently called upon for getting samples from difficult sticks). She says if my wife agrees then go ahead. A short moment later I had the line in place and stepped aside. The nurse smiles and said you just made my job easier.

The mentor program is one of the big ways they want to differentiate themselves.  I mentored a new grad over the past year and it went really well.  When hiring a new grad we picked someone that was going to be in charge of their mentorship (me).  I then went to MVPs mentor training course which was really helpful in talking about training and communication styles, managing goals and expectations etc.  MVP gave us time once a week (had us block off appointments) so that we could meet outside the hospital and discuss how things were going, talk about cases, goals, any changes we wanted to make and give feedback to each other on how things were going.  I had oversight and guidance from vets at the home office and my mentee sent them reviews on how I was doing as a mentor.  

We also had a pretty structured way on how we started her off with appointments to give time for mentoring and learning and didn't start increasing appointment numbers until she was ready to take in more. 
 
Way different from the old days where you just sank or swam and hoped that maybe someone was available help answer a question once in a while"
ItzMichaelHD,I got rejected from every vet school first time around and then got a place at one of the best vet schools in the UK second year. Don’t give up!
National_Count_4916,"Mars Inc currently owns Banfield and VCA hospital chains. Petco/Petsmart are getting in on putting clinics in their stores

Both Banfield and VCA are offering $20-$50/month subscriptions to capture clientele which offer unlimited exams (not diagnostics), bi annual comprehensive exams and cleanings

They own, or long term lease free standing buildings and can equip them and staff. A typical clinic has a business manager, 1-2 vets 5-6 days a week and techs

That’s really stiff competition for a practice 

Covid saw a huge explosion in pet adoption, future years may not have as many owned pets to service

What I have seen be fairly lucrative is mobile specialists who can supplement existing practices. You own the business, and any specialty equipment (ultrasound), and can have production. MoVes does this. There’s also the mobile to client model"
By_default_,"While we didn't get as many wildlife lectures as companion animals, livestock, or equine, my school did include them and we had wildlife rotations in our clinical year where the students were very hands on. This likely varies from school to school but there are many that have strong wildlife programs. I agree that undergrad +/- a master's in wildlife programs would be beneficial, not only in getting a solid knowledge base in wildlife, but also in building relationships with people who may have connections at those schools which would help when applying."
timbo10184,"I love this.  We have been conditioned to think about a spay procedure as ""simple"" and should be done without complication and quickly.  Consider a splenectomy.  It's basically the same thing, removing an organ that the patient can live without.  Those procedures are usually either referred or watched closely and kept overnight.  Stop minimizing what you are doing.  It's anesthesia, it's surgery.  Things can go wrong, things WILL go wrong given enough time and chances.  An old Vet once told me to never say ""I would never do that"" or ""that will never happen to me"".  As long as you can go over the whole scenario and truly say you didn't purposely neglect something dangerous, you need to give yourself that grace.  Don't give up OP.  Mistakes are made, but learn from them.

Consider yourself forged by Vet school.  Time and experience will harden you and sharpen things to a point where you will be much better than your starting point."
SuddenHedgehog,"It’s not uncommon for the techs to call the doctors by their first name in the back where I work. We were told at the beginning by one doctor that they didn’t care as long as in front of clients and visiting specialists, we say Dr Last Name. If it’s something that bothers you, tell the hospital manager and they should include it in a staff meeting. But it won’t ingratiate you to the techs.

As far as nit picking, I do just want to say that a lot of techs only know what they know by experience. So when you do a treatment plan or something that isn’t aligned with their experience, they get nervous. They don’t know that their actions are the right thing to do in every circumstance, they just know it’s what they were asked to do. I think that’s why some techs get rude with newer doctors. Once they see your patients are coming back healthy and happy, once they see you catch a few cool weird things, the respect will build up.|Me asking questions has definitely saved us a few times, either cuz it was communicated wrong or it was the wrong thing.|As someone who just got accepted to vet school, thank you. I needed to hear that lol|Advice I got was to leave your first few practices until you find one you like! You’ve got much more to explore before calling it quits.

Creepy_Philosophy_17,"New grad here too. Not quite sure about the west coast but I heard CA pays more than the east coast regions due to high taxes, and I was offered 120K-140K by different companies and these were like 30-1hr drive from the HCOL area east coast. My friends were offered 170-180K in NYC HCOL area. I feel like OC CA is extremely HCOL area so you should ask for more base salary. Also probs ask for more PTO and more CE?|yes, I am aware of that, but isn't there a contract/ offer letter signing?? 

Is there nothing like that? I was wondering when would you ""sign"" a legal document with them. 

Thanks!!|Yes, I do know that I will be penalized if I decline as I said above. However, just wanted to know the General timeline of what happens after the match!

I'll do some more research! thanks so much!!|Okay, got it!!!

Nervous_Ad2818,"You should be fine! I think medicine in general is modernizing, and tattoos aren’t as taboo as they used to be.

I did work in two different vet clinics in Texas, one in the city and one in the boondocks. Both Dr.’s were “old-fashioned” and required tats and “unconventional” piercings to be covered/ removed.

Regardless, I feel like even the most old-fashioned of “the old generation” clients would find a tattoo in honor of a beloved pet to be touching, and even a good conversation starter. You’re also picking a place that’s easy to cover if ever needed.

So sorry for your loss, would love to see the piece when done💕🐾💕"

Mountain-Crab-7668,"Practice Manager here to say, you can probably get a job literally anywhere. Ask for an observation interview and really pay attention to the staff, how do they interact with each other, how do the techs treat the kennel or reception staff and visa versa. Do they ask each other for help, do they offer help when no one asks. Are the Veterinarians belittling the staff, if so they probably will not mentor you either. Everyone in the clinic matters and should be treated that way. 

You can probably even get a contract that doesn't require a 30+ day notice if you explain that you are looking for a place that is working towards removing toxicity in the field and follows through with mentorship; you've been burned in the past and do not want either party to feel stuck staying where you don't belong or needing to leave short notice because of toxicity.|You are amazing. People like you are exactly what we need in this field."
MackeDaddy,"PetVet suckssssss. Even on a GP level. They're all about increasing prices and pushing employees to their limit to see everything that walks in the door.

Still haven't received mine from November, and I doubt I ever will. And to comment on your other reply, idk what the governors could really do since it's an independent Corp. Or if theyd even feel a need to do anything. Human nurses had to unionize to get the pay they are at, and it's still not enough for what they do. 

I feel like more people should be aware of the good and bad vet corps out there, it'd limit the amount of people they'd be able to screw over.|It probably wouldn't hurt to reach out and see what options they offer as far as that goes. I don't have much knowledge on that. But I understand everyone's experience with most corporate businesses is mostly clinic based, and not all clinics under a corporation are bad/negative. I have enjoyed most* of the people I've met through petvet, but I've enjoyed being out of PetVet so much more. There are better corps out there that genuinely take steps to put their employees first, but there's always pros and cons anywhere you go, and everyone's thresholds are different."
SnooPeppers1434,"Yes, they have great testimonials on their website!"
merriecho,"Run!  Not all clinics are like this.  Sounds like the whole clinic is tired, you should not have to do the check in, exam, discharge by yourself.  

Every clinic I've managed has had at Least 1 tech per doctor with 1-2 TA's there to help.  Not to mention a reception staff.  

As others have said, get out before there tired old horrible habits start to stick.

pandaperson46,"Any idea when they'll re-upload?|Hi! This is definitely a tough one. Unfortunately, many places will allow you to go shadow but likely will not hire you on their payroll for just a extended break or summertime experience. By doing this at the same place a few times, however, they may recognize your commitment and eventually hire you part-time for when you're in the area.

The unfortunate reality of trying to get veterinary hours... 

Does this answer your question? Or are you referring to just general shadowing experience?|I'm sorry... The NYC area can be tough with this type of stuff. I would first off say that you will unlikely get a place that will hire you, but I think you should be able to find a place to let you shadow to get that experience and those hours in. I like to think that so many veterinarians have been in the same place as you and would like to help.

In my experience, I think that people are more receptive over the phone rather than email. I'd encourage you to call the front desk of a couple places you are interested in and ask to speak with the hospital director or leave your contact info!

Hope this helps a little and that you find what you're looking for."

xdg07,">Are we expected to see a traffic increase for non-whitelisted nodes in the near future?

Yes, definitely. Both dVPN and B2B product usage is growing. Our network traffic almost doubled during this year while dVPN app user base grew 5x. Also, we're improving B2B client infrastructure, so their traffic is more equally distributed between more providers. In order to get more earnings it's recommended to have your node up 24/7, use residential IP and of course check which countries are the most demanded (like UK, US, CA, AU, NZ, FR, IT, DE, IN, SG, HK, CH, MY and so on).|>Why should I invest in MYST now? What are your plans to drive value to the token?

MYST token is used directly in the network which means that the bigger network the bigger demand for MYST tokens. In other words, all Mysterium network consumers (both dVPN app users or B2B clients) need MYST token to pay for Network services, so with growing network there will be constant demand for MYST token. As mentioned above, both our dVPN consumer and B2B client base is growing, meaning that network traffic is increasing as well.  
Additionally, you can stake your MYST token into Delegation pool https://app.iq.space/ (powered by our partners IQ protocol) and earn rewards.|>Is there a specific reason that Mysterium VPN is not listed on the Apple store?

Yes, the main issue was technical iOS requirements for the runtime. Due to decentralised P2P network specifics, our VPN apps has to include the whole node code which makes runtime bigger than allowed. However, the good news is that we already found a solution and iOS app is in our short term plans. We've already started working on the designs and hopefully will be able to release it during this year.|>How do you protect your users from bad actors? If the nodes are permissionless, can a node operator simply log all the traffic?

All node runners accept Terms and Conditions which do not allow them to do that. Also, majority of traffic is HTTPS which is encrypted anyway.|Great question. You can check statistics on stats.mysterium.network (this page is also getting additional statistics in a couple of weeks). Also, you can check mystnodes.com and try to start your own node. Then, you could also download MysteriumVPN from Google Play Store or for other platforms from mysteriumvpn.com and check the nodes yourself.|Currently we have 8 VPN/proxy B2B clients running and also talking to a few more. 

And as you mentioned because network is permissionless, you can also just come and build on top of it without any contract.

I hope we can have the first non-VPN/Proxy on board really soon.|As mentioned in Twitter spaces, we're still in the process of updating Tokenomics 2.0 logic.

Yes, definitely. Both dVPN and B2B product usage is growing. Our network traffic almost doubled during this year while dVPN app user base grew 5x. Also, we're improving B2B client infrastructure, so their traffic is more equally distributed between more providers. In order to get more earnings it's recommended to have your node up 24/7, use residential IP and of course check which countries are the most demanded (like UK, US, CA, AU, NZ, FR, IT, DE, IN, SG, HK, CH, MY and so on).|>Why should I invest in MYST now? What are your plans to drive value to the token?

MYST token is used directly in the network which means that the bigger network the bigger demand for MYST tokens. In other words, all Mysterium network consumers (both dVPN app users or B2B clients) need MYST token to pay for Network services, so with growing network there will be constant demand for MYST token. As mentioned above, both our dVPN consumer and B2B client base is growing, meaning that network traffic is increasing as well.  
Additionally, you can stake your MYST token into Delegation pool https://app.iq.space/ (powered by our partners IQ protocol) and earn rewards.|>Is there a specific reason that Mysterium VPN is not listed on the Apple store?

Yes, the main issue was technical iOS requirements for the runtime. Due to decentralised P2P network specifics, our VPN apps has to include the whole node code which makes runtime bigger than allowed. However, the good news is that we already found a solution and iOS app is in our short term plans.

badgerhoneyy,"I've started with them recently. It's not a vet-client relationship, most of the questions are fairly straight forward. You get the transcript of the original enquiry, so I usually need to ask a couple of follow up questions. Most things are similar to r/askvet \- you're basically telling them to go to their usual vet, and advising if it's an emergency or can wait until Monday, that sort of thing. Other's are asking for nutritional advice, there'a a bit of behaviour, which I find is just too involved for the format, or owners just needing a bit of reassurance. So far, I don't mind it at all. You get to chose the questions you answer, and can accept phone enquires too which pay more, but I've not done that. 

  
The pay structure was not transparent until after my final training, but once you're signed on it's clear what you get paid for each question. Most are $11, some have a bonus attached, and I think with more experience that can go up too. There is no minimum number you are required to answer, but I find if I put a couple of hours aside to sit and dedicate a bit of time to it a couple of times a week, that works well for me. 

  
I'm a practicing vet, but not based in the US, so our regulations and insurance are different, so I can't comment on that. I think I read that VIN might have advice on that for the US folks. 

It did take them a long time to get me set up, it was a few months between my 'interview' and getting verified, and then getting alerted to being set up. So be prepared for that.|I honestly have no idea. Probably worth contacting them.|Yeah. Can only assume units are different as we’d aim for BG of half that!|Slightly different, but I applied for the five year, didn’t make the grades of the conditional offer, and was invited to join the six year course instead. At the time it felt like a failing of some sort, that I was somehow second rate, and that the extra year would seem like forever. I swallowed my pride and did the six year course. 

That was ten years ago and I actually really loved vet school, and love being a vet. Hell I can complain about it as vocally as the next burnt-out jaded overworked underpaid MRCVS, but if you want to be a vet, then relish the offer and have a blast!"

[Anatomy in Clay](https://www.anatomyinclay.com/)|My Dad is a sculptor/carver and I’m a vet that specializes in equine bodywork. I was looking for cool things we might do together and I stumbled on it. Have a great time!|Laugh! Vet school is full of opportunities to make friends, whether in study groups or at happy hour (ours was every Friday). First laugh of most vet students? Usually in canine anatomy lab when someone tells you to “approach your bitch”. Keep your sense of humor and you’ll be fine!|I love the matting that comes in large rolls (usually 8 feet wide by however long you need. Once properly installed, they last for years as aisle flooring with minimal cracks to clean. In areas like wash stalls or grooming bays I prefer traditional stall mats- they hold up better to inpatient, pawing horses|I was a manager in a similar situation. The employee would be chronically late and insult coworkers. I was very aware we had a toxic employee and literally did everything I could to remedy the situation by removing them from our workplace. Out of respect for the team, everything was kept behind closed doors. The only people who knew exactly what was going on were the employee, myself, and our regional manager (it was a corporate practice). 

Your managers may be doing all they can at this point. Depending on state and company policy it might not be easy to let this employee go. I had to give 3 written warnings, then give a paid day off, then accept a letter of explanation from the employee for their behavior for consideration before we could fire them.|Again, that probably varies. Toxic employees seem to know how to toe the line but not cross it. 

For example, the fact that this person routinely made coworkers cry was not anything I could write up. Clocking in late routinely was. After that warning, they started clocking in early (5-15min per shift).  Definitely a passive aggressive move.  Passive aggression I could not write up but the fact that it cost the company to pay for time/ overtime that hadn’t been scheduled was an offense that could be written up. 

No one wants to have a wrongful dismissal suit brought against them. Some also don’t have unemployment insurance and can’t afford to fire an employee so they are pressured to quit instead. Lots of factors apply.|One of the practices I worked for early on was a single vet who was terrible at business. He desperately wanted to fire an employee because he quite simply did not like her. She caught wind of it and quit, he emphatically made sure everyone was aware she quit and that there was no way she could come after him for unemployment $$. And yes, in the US. Honestly it might be illegal to have employees and not carry it, but it wouldn’t have been the first questionable business decision that practice made.|Sure!"

marchbanks273,"Hey OP,

I have also gone through what you're going through. I had minimal vet experience before and through my degree, and COVID ruined my final year placements as a 2020 grad (they became online school instead). I came out as a veterinarian that had little knowledge and skill and as a result I suffered so much anxiety and imposter syndrome. It got to the point where I became scared of doing any consult where the patient was mildly sick and I almost left the industry.

I'm now three years out and at a teaching hospital teaching final year students, and it's cool to see how far I've come. What helped me was a supportive environment while I found my confidence. Vomiting cases more complicated than a maropitant injection used to terrify me, especially if they came back the next day. Now I actively enjoy the puzzle of figuring out the next steps instead of reacting with fear. I have coworkers that love to contribute their thoughts and are there to support me when things still don't go right. Even if you make a mistake, then the least you can do is make it a learning experience for yourself so that the next patient you encounter will benefit from what you've learned. I still get anxious time to time, and I think my first year as a new grad was not great for my imposter syndrome but time and experience has helped me so much with my nerves. You should never too be hard on yourself as a new grad - I'm sure the past you in early DVM would be very proud of the things you've achieved as a veterinarian, and when you're a seasoned vet you'll also look back on how far you've come. All the best!|I'm an ER vet as well and I personally found this to be more useful over Thrall and radiology CE for my learning. Our clinic uses VetCT and when submitting radiographs you can ask specific questions you want answered. I usually have a go interpreting it myself and then you can get direct feedback from a radiologist. You have the option of discussing it further with them if required. I like it because they'll label where in the radiograph they see the pathology.

Okaythenn7,"I’m a 12th grader in Hungary but i want to go abroad for my uni years. (Most likely Austria or Germany)
I only speak Hungarian and English and of course thought of studying veterinary medicine in English, but as far as i’m concerned there are no vetmed universities in Austria that teach in English. 
In Germany… there may be one but i’m not so sure. 
I’ve heard that in Vienna they offer half a year only teaching German so that i could study in German but my level of said language is… low to say the least."
No-Satisfaction-325,"But what if a vet is wrong? They are human. They deal with animals that can’t talk. I can see the frustration.|Sorry, what country? There are many people in different countries. I’m from Canada."
balkantraveller,"Try an externship with other pathologists. They're usually smart, interesting, not super neurotic, and eager to teach, all of which I love. 

If you enjoy path but are still primarily interested in wildlife, you could have a well-paying private industry path job fund some amount of time doing wildlife vet work. Because a lot of path is remote, this gives you flexibility re: living near wildlife medicine/rehab centers. 

If all dead trumps hands-on wildlife medicine, you could try to quasi-specialize (i.e., become the go-to person) in exotic and zoo species path in an academic setting. Depending on how non-traditional you are and your appetite for further education/not making money for awhile, you could do a relevant PhD actually honing in on some wildlife/zoo/exotic niche, and the PhD is beneficial if you're interested in academic jobs. 

My point is that path is needed, versatile, and well-compensated, and that could afford you options and flexibility that are hard to arrange in most areas of vet med.|Having a case study published after only three semesters of vet school seems pretty far-fetched unless someone comes in: 1) with some relevant experience (definitely happens, but uncommon) and 2) knowing they want to do path from the get-go. 

You do, however, need to build relationships with the pathologists and begin to gain experience in the field. Even if all of the paid necropsy, histo, and diagnostic lab positions are filled, figure out what you need to do to shadow and then begin to get research experience. You might want to start talking to people at your school about summer work now in case the external summer program doesn't pan out. 

I wouldn't say you're behind if you start shadowing/working/doing research this semester. Yes, there are people who know they want to do path in their first year, but most don't really figure it out until you get more exposure to the field in your second year.|Amazing! I haven't seen vet med scribes in real life, but I'd heard rumors they were out there. If you're comfortable sharing, which company do you work for? Are you the only one, or are there others at your hospital?|Ethical wool, bee colonies (can be rented out as pollinators in addition to the honey), or possibly ethical down, though this last option is connected to meat farming (ethical down doesn't allow for live plucking, but you could argue that pushing the needle by investing in ethical down promotes better welfare for these animals) may be reasonable options.|20 hrs/wk would be a lot, though maybe you could average to that by working more over the summer and holidays. It would depend on your post-graduation goals, too. If you are interested in GP or another path you can do without additional training, you won't have the same expectation for research involvement, shadowing in your area of interest, etc., during your pre-clinical years. The pressure around grades (even at P/F schools) will also be lower if you're planning on pursuing GP. If you're interested in residency training, however, then research, clinical exposure, and networking are absolutely essential, and they can easily take up 10+ hrs/wk."

Sea_Explanation6496,"They usually show you around the clinic and introduce you to the other staff members and maybe have you shadow someone for a bit. I have had one job hand me a worksheet that had common veterinary pharmacy questions on it (this was a vet assistant pharmacy position).

My recommendations are: 1) Go to your in state school and work your hardest to take out the least amount of loans possible. Loans and loan interest add up quickly, and even having a great starting salary can make paying them off difficult. If you end up with loans well over 150,000, the monthly payment can be higher than a mortgage payment. It can be hard to fathom what that looks like until you have to pay them back. 2) Work at or extern at clinics you're interested in working in if able. There was a clinic I shadowed at once that offered me a job, so I spent 2 weeks as an extern my clincial year... discovered a toxic culture and what would have been a very unsupportive mentor. 3) Get varied experiences...shelter vs GP vs. ER, etc. Can help you appreciate the differences between each and identify what you might be interested in. 4) Work-life balance! Don't be afraid to ask for it and take your vacation days. Working every weekend and overtime is the quickest road to burnout. 5) Practice good mental and physical health now, so you have a good system in place to deal with stress and compassion fatigue.|I think it was a valid offer.

I wanted to make a proposal to submit to him to open a small animal clinic grooming service in a provincial town that has an animal clinic 5hrs from the town. I will have to contact the local municipality and see if i can open a shop in town.
